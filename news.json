            "Content": "huong@thestar.com.my\nPETALING JAYA: Edaran Tan Chong Motor Sdn Bhd (ETCM ) expects the company's vehicle sales to grow more than 2.5% year-on-year in 2012 with the introduction of new models.\nETCM executive director Datuk Dr Ang Bon Beng told StarBiz: \u201cWe are confident that our vehicle sales would exceed the industry growth as we are going to launch models in segments where we are not currently represented. This is expected to win market share from competitors.\u201d\nThe Malaysian Automotive Association had forecast new vehicle sales to hit a record high of 615,000 units this year, which is a 2.5% increase from the 600,123 units achieved in 2011.\nETCM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd (TCMH), is thesales and marketing arm for Nissan vehicles in Malaysia.\nAng said the group would have a new Nissan model line-up this year which included a B-segment sedan and a replacement van model for the Nissan Vanette C22.\nBoth vehicles would be locally assembled.\n\u201cWe are also going to introduce some interesting CBU (completely built-up) models which are selling well in various markets globally,\u201d he said.\nLast year, the group sold about 31,000 units of Nissan vehicles, which was 6.8% lower than the sales volume in 2010.\nAng said the group's sales in 2011 was affected by the global supply chain disruption to the vehicle industry as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan as well as the Thai flood crisis late last year.\nAng said that the group was recently awarded with contract assembly jobs.\nLast year, Tan Chong International Ltd, a distributor of Subaru vehicles, appointed Tan Chong Motor Assemblies Sdn Bhd to contract assemble the Subaru XV model, which would be sold in Asean markets.\nProduction of the Subaru model is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012 at the group's assembly plant in Segambut, Kuala Lumpur with an initial annual volume of 5,000 units.\nThe group would also assemble Bison light trucks in Malaysia for Warisan TC Holdings Bhd.\nIt is also negotiating and finalising applications to the Sabah state government for incentives packages to set up a vehicle manufacturing facility at the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park.\nIn November 2010, TCMH had told Bursa Malaysia that the group had been granted a licence by the Government to manufacture and assemble luxury passenger and commercial vehicles in Sabah.\nThe conditions for the licence included that production would be for luxury passenger cars with engine capacities of 1.8 litres and above, and with on-the-road price tags of not less than RM150,000 per unit.\nTCMH had planned to invest up to RM285mil for the manufacturing facility (including buying 50 acres of land), which would produce 4-wheel drive vehicles with an initial capacity of 3,000 units per year.\nThe group's vehicle plant in Danang, Vietnam is due to be operational in the second quarter of 2012 and would roll out the Nissan B-segment cars by the fourth quarter.\nThe Danang plant is planned as a regional hub for the production of Nissan vehicles, which would be distributed within the Indochina region.\n\u201cGoing forward, we are expected to assemble more Nissan variants in Danang for the Vietnam market. We would also explore, together with Nissan Motor Co, export opportunities to neighbouring nations such as Cambodia and Laos which are lefthand drive markets.\u201d\nFor the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2011, TCMH posted a 10.6% year-on-year increase in net profit to RM54.5mil, and the group said its gross margins had remained intact due to favourable foreign exchange rates on imports.\nRevenue for the quarter under review increased 3.9% year-on-year to RM905.4mil.\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, 2011, the group posted a 4.2% year-on-year increase in net profit to RM185.1mil, while revenue grew 11.6% to RM2.98bil.\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS11 Mar 2019\nJapan court blocks ex-Nissan boss Ghosn from attending board meeting\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Feb 2019\nUK deeply disappointed by Honda's decision to close plant\nANALYST REPORTS26 Feb 2019\nCIMB Research retains Hold for Tan Chong, TP unch RM1.25"

It also maintained its Reduce recommendation with a lower target price of 30 sen, now based on 20 times CY20F P/E.\n\n\u201cWe expect a stronger earnings recovery in FY19F, driven by new tester introduction for radio frequency (RF) and Internet of Things (IoT), resilient demand in enterprise and favourable forex,\u201d it said.\n\nCommenting on the results, it said 4QFY9/18 revenue dropped by 29% on-quarter due to lower RF tester shipment volumes as customers are turning more cautious in view of the escalating trade war between the US and China. \n\nDespite this, Aemulus still managed to capture new sales from its new Korean customer in the quarter. Following lower tester shipment volume, 4QFY18 core net profit plunged 83% on-quarter. \n\nNevertheless, the group declared its first interim dividend of 0.2 sen per share in the quarter, ahead of its expectation.\n\nAemulus\u2019s FY9/18 gross profit fell by 7.1% on-year, mainly due to lower RF tester sales, especially in Malaysia and China markets, which recorded 54% and 59% sales declines, respectively.\n\nThe group attributed the lower sales to lower capex allocation by domestic outsource assembly and test providers and cautious sentiment from customers in China in view of the escalating trade war.\n \nApart from that, Aemulus still maintained a lucrative 63.1% gross profit margin in FY18 (vs. 62.7% in FY17). Overall, the group\u2019s FY18 net profit slid 30% on-year.\n\n\u201cWe cut our FY19-20F EPS by 25-26% to reflect a lower tester shipment assumption in view of the sluggish outlook in the smartphone and tablet segment.\n \n\u201cNevertheless, we still expect Aemulus to deliver a stronger earnings recovery in FY19F, driven by new testers baseband microcontroller and IoT applications and resilient demand in the enterprise segment, which accounted for about 40% of the group\u2019s revenue in FY18,\u201d it said.\n\nCIMB Research said in addition, the group shared that its latest venture into developing new hardware and software solutions in the artificial intelligence (AI) space is progressing as planned. \n\nThe group has started shipments of beta versions to selected customers for testing and expects the new venture to jumpstart its entry into the smart manufacturing segment. \n\n\u201cWe like Aemulus\u2019s strategy of expanding into smart manufacturing, but we do not expect any meaningful contribution from this venture until FY20F.\n\n\u201cWe maintain our Reduce rating with a lower 30 sen TP, as we roll over our valuation to end-2019, pegged at 20 times CY20F P/E, in line with the sector\u2019s three-year historical mean. We see delays in new tester launches as a de-rating catalyst. \n\n\u201cKey upside risks to our call are new customer wins and better earnings delivery from new tester models.

In some cases, for the short-term, but in most cases, for the longer-term.\nThe depressed prices are giving investors opportunities to start scouting around and maybe start nibbling at certain counters that are seeing some real value emerging.\nIn this regard, StarBizWeek has chosen 10 counters for investors to look at.\nThe stocks are picks by fund managers and journalists that track corporate companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.\nFUND MANAGERS\u2019 PICKS\nFRANCIS ENG\nChief investment officer\nUOB Asset Management (M) Bhd\nPENTAMASTER CORP BHD\nMarket capitalisation: RM747.1mil\nFifty-two-week high: RM3.79\nFifty-two-week low: RM1.70\nPENTAMASTER is an automated testing, automation manufacturing and technology solutions provider. The company\u2019s main customers are in the telecommunications, automotive, semiconductor, consumer electronics and medical devices industry. Pentamaster employs over 350 engineers and is based in Penang.\nWe believe that Pentamaster can sustain its earnings momentum going forward, underpinned by a few key factors. Firstly, we expect demand for Pentamaster\u2019s testing solutions to be driven by increasing volume of smart sensors and 3D sensing technology in smartphones.\nSecondly, Pentamaster\u2019s continuous diversification efforts and expansion into new segments, particularly the automotive and medical industries, are starting to yield results. Demand from the automotive and medical sectors tends to be relatively more stable compared with semiconductors, which can be cyclical. There are growth prospects for Pentamaster in the automotive sector, especially in electric vehicles.\nEng: Pentamaster can sustain its earnings momentum.\nThirdly, Pentamaster has developed in-house automation systems which have capabilities in automating manufacturing processes. We believe that there is strong growth potential for such systems as more manufacturing companies embrace Industry 4.0.\nPentamaster is poised to capture opportunities as its capacity has almost tripled with the completion of a new plant in Batu Kawan in mid-2018.\nAdditionally, Pentamaster could be a beneficiary of the US-China trade war if multinational manufacturers who shift their production from China to Malaysia were to source their test equipment from local suppliers.\nValuation-wise, Pentamaster is trading at a price earnings ratio (PER) of 10 times in financial year 2019, which is at a discount to its equipment maker peers which are trading at more than 20 times the PER.

            "Content": "PETALING JAYA: Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd\u2019s proposed deal to acquire stockbroker Inter-Pacific Securities Sdn Bhd (Interpac) has been called off.\nIn a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, Kenanga said that both parties had \u201cmutually agreed to terminate the proposed acquisition.\u201d However, no reason for the termination was given.\nSources said this was due primarily to \u201cmarket conditions\u201d, but did not elaborate.\nIn May, just after the 14th general election, Kenanga said it had been given the green light to start talks in relation to the purchase of the stockbroking business of Interpac.\nThe proposed deal was seen as the first large corporate deal to be announced under the new Pakatan Harapan government that had come into power in that same month.\nA source said amid the current volatile markets, the parties could not reach an agreement on the terms of the deal.\n\u201cThere were too many things to iron out,\u201d said the source. If it had materialised, the parties, Kenanga and Inter-Pacific, which is the stockbroking arm of Berjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) controlled by local tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan Chee Yioun, would have created one of the largest stockbrokers in the country.\nTan\u2019s BCorp wholly owns Berjaya Capital Bhd, which owns 91.5% of Inter-Pacific Capital Sdn Bhd which, in turn, owns all of Interpac. Given that the proposed deal would have been financed by shares in Kenanga as well as cash, Tan through BCorp could very likely have emerged as one of the larger shareholders in the merged entity.\nPricing-wise, in the proposed deal, it was envisaged that Kenanga would not have forked out a premium for its smaller rival\u2019s broking business to expand its remisier base.\n\u201cGoing by industry benchmark, Kenanga should be looking to pay around one to 1.1 times book value for Interpac.\n\u201cThat should work out to less than RM120mil,\u201d a banker had estimated earlier.\nKenanga Investment, founded in 1973, offers a wide range of financial services operating through 32 branches nationwide. It also reportedly has the largest remisier network in the country.\nIt counts Sarawak-based CMS Capital Sdn Bhd as its single largest shareholder.\nCMS Capital is the private company linked to former Sarawak Chief Minister Tun Abdul Taib Mahmud. Interpac, meanwhile, was set up in 1972 and has five branches across Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Baru. It has a paid-up capital of RM250mil. The last major merger and acquisition deal in the stockbroking industry here was about four years ago when Affin Holdings Bhd acquired Hwang-DBS Investment Bhd at 1.3 times price-to-book.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nBanking , Kenanga Investment Bank\n    Related News\nBANKING07 Feb 2019\nNeutral outlook seen for banking sector\nCORPORATE NEWS24 Jan 2019\nCIMB sells stake in CHIB\nCORPORATE NEWS25 Jan 2019\nBenchmark interest rate stays at 3.25%"

The losses were due to a RM7.3bil impairment made by Khazanah, which is now headed by a new managing director and board.\nRoughly half of those impairments came from MAS alone.\nSo the question is, why the impairment in MAS of more than RM3bil?\nRelated story:\nTo save or not to save MAS?\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

Khazanah may be willing to part with Malaysia Airlines, if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted,\u201d it said.\nNonetheless, HLIB said the government should consider the airline\u2019s large workforce of 14,000 before considering to shut it down.\n\u201cWe believe it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines instead of shutting down, or find a strategic partner, which will solve the issue of government\u2019s cash drain.\n\u201cThis will reducing the overall impact on staff layoffs, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the operation,\u201d it said.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nAirlines , Corporate News\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS04 Mar 2019\nAirAsia to permanently withdraw sales from Traveloka\nAIRLINES22 Feb 2019\nAirAsia X posts third straight quarter of net loss on fuel cost\nCORPORATE NEWS31 Jan 2019\nAirAsia serves RM480m claim on Malaysia Airports"

An infrastructure blitz that takes Thailand\u2019s economy to new heights.\n\nThat\u2019s the vision of the Thai military junta, which has ruled the Southeast Asian nation since seizing control in a coup in 2014, and is now looking to bring its leader, Prayuth Chan-Ocha, back as prime minister in the March 24 election.\n\nIts economic plan rests on a 1.7 trillion baht ($54 billion) spending push to revive competitiveness in an economy hamstrung by depressed business confidence and investment. Growth has lagged peers in the region, productivity has weakened and companies have been reluctant to invest in an environment of trade tensions and political uncertainty.\n\nThe return of democracy comes with its own risks: a possible messy exit from five years of repressive military rule that is clouding the economic outlook.\n\nThailand\u2019s establishment elites have dueled for power with the populist alliance of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra for over a decade, a fault line that could bring gridlock to the next parliament. He or his supporters prevailed in each election since 2001, only to be unseated by the military or the courts.\n\nThe instability has weighed on competitiveness and investment, both of which the junta has struggled to turn around since taking power.\n\n\u201cImproving national competitiveness is super urgent,\u201d said Somprawin Manprasert, the chief economist at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, a Thai unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. \u201cThailand can ill-afford another period of lagging behind from political disorder. I believe we\u2019ve bottomed out as people realize we need to improve productivity.\u201d\n\nThailand has dropped 10 places on the World Economic Forum\u2019s global competitiveness index since 2007 -- the biggest decline among Southeast Asia\u2019s top economies -- to rank 38th out of 140 countries last year. The index measures everything from the openness of the economy and quality of infrastructure to the strength of institutions and innovation.\n\nInvestment as a share of gross domestic product has also been steadily sliding over the years, capping the economy\u2019s expansion.

            "Content": "Learning from others: Aslinah participates in trade shows to learn new trends in the market.\nPEOPLE often do a double-take when they find out Aslinah Aslam\u2019s age when she founded Azaib Holdings \u2013 she was 25 years old. They are even more surprised to know that she started her chocolate manufacturing company with no practical business experience.\nWhat Aslinah lacked in experience, however, she more than made up in \u201crempuh spirit\u201d, as she calls it.\n\u201cIn my early days, if phone calls and emails got me nowhere, I would personally turn up at the reception armed with product samples and my company profile. In business, you must follow up, push and rempuh (charge aggressively) till you break through!\u201d\nThis never-say-die attitude has propelled the company\u2019s growth from a home-based startup to an international player in less than a decade. Azaib has carved a distinctive niche with its Belgian chocolate-covered freeze-dried tropical fruits.\nAslinah\u2019s foray into business was sparked by a weekend project helping an entrepreneur friend.\nThen working as a bank officer, she found the experience of meeting a variety of interesting people completely different from sitting in an office processing documents.\n\u201cI told myself, someday, I\u2019ll be an entrepreneur too.\u201d\nWhen her employer offered a Voluntary Separation Scheme in 2009, Aslinah saw the opportunity to put her plan in motion.\nFrozen fruits: Workers manning the machine, which freeze-dries fruits for in-house products and OEM customers.\n\u201cI figured the severance package would come in handy as seed capital for my business venture, whatever that might be,\u201d she says.\nWhile scouting for opportunities, she heard that airport duty-free retailer Eraman was looking for a local chocolate supplier to showcase a Malaysian brand alongside their imported brands.\nAslinah happened to be a skilled baker whose creations, including chocolate, were a hit with family and friends.\nAfter surveying the market, she brainstormed furiously to distinguish her product from the ones on offer. Her praline confections, sold under the Malsa brand, beat out three other competitors and won her an initial order of RM40,000.\nWith an order in hand, Aslinah needed a proper production facility; doing it in her family kitchen was out of the question. Friends pointed her to the National Cocoa Board, which had an incubator programme to help budding chocolate entrepreneurs.\nAslinah went ahead and rented its facilities in Nilai, which provide product development trial services for pre-commercialisation purposes, although it was a long drive from home.\n\u201cSince we could only use the facilities from 8am-5pm, I had to leave home at 5.30am so that I can maximise my time. If I\u2019m late, rugi-lah. We do the production as fast as we can. Eat lunch also cepat-cepat, 10-15 minutes in rotation,\u201d she shares.\nShe also rented a friend\u2019s factory which had different machines.\n\u201cMy friend\u2019s factory could produce praline chocolates, heart-shaped and flower-shaped chocolates, while the Nilai facilities had bigger machines that could produce round-shaped chocolates in higher volumes.\u201d\nEven with all that going on, Aslinah made time to travel to Belgium for R&D purposes.\n\u201cI knew I had to upgrade my skills and continuously improve my recipe. What better way than to visit and learn from the top factories in the country synonymous with quality chocolates?\u201d\nHer unrelenting focus on perfectionism paid off in 2012, when a customer bought her products off the shelves from Cold Storage. The customer, an international trader, was so impressed that she tracked Aslinah down and offered her the opportunity to supply to China.\nThus, Aslinah snagged her first overseas order of RM150,000.\nNo guts, no glory\nWhile luck played a role in the company\u2019s expansion, a deciding factor in Azaib\u2019s story is its founder\u2019s initiative.\nAslinah recalls the time she sealed her spot in a Matrade\u2019s women entrepreneurs programme.\n\u201cI was a nobody then. But when I spotted the CEO in the canteen, I brazenly walked up to him and told him I\u2019m a growing SME who just broke into the China market, and needed support to expand. I told him, \u2018I have applied for the women entrepreneurs\u2019 programme, can you please look at it?\u2019\u201d\nThe reward for a thick skin was priceless.\n\u201cThe programme gave us the opportunity to attend international trade shows, where we learn about pricing, sampling, marketing, quality standards, negotiation skills, which markets are hot, what\u2019s the next big thing. I found the learning so invaluable that even after the programme, I allocate a part of my annual budget for trade shows because I believe the investment is worth it,\u201d she says.\nHer participation in a trade show in Thailand in 2012 led her to what eventually became her core product.\nShe noticed that the Thais were promoting their local fruits aggressively and a light bulb went off in her head \u2013 why not incorporate tropical fruits into chocolate products? Malaysia had a wealth of delicious fruits that would complement chocolates, and more importantly, give her brand a unique selling point to stand out in the competitive landscape.\nUnfortunately, she hit a stone wall. Commercial freeze-drying technology was not yet widely available in Malaysia and buying a machine, costing over RM1mil, was not a viable option.\nIf she wanted to go ahead with her plan, she would have to source freeze-dried fruits from outside Malaysia.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about it but I had to act on the opportunity while I had first mover advantage,\u201d she admits.\nAzaib shipped out its first batch of chocolate-wrapped fruits in 2012 using imported freeze-fried fruits.\nA year later, Aslinah received a big order from China for freeze-dried durian. Fortunately, by then, she had also found a local company with freeze-drying facilities.\n\u201cIt was uncharted territory, but I thought the risk was worth taking because the freeze dried fruits could be used for our chocolates too. I was excited that I now had a real chance to support local farmers,\u201d she says.\nWith help from the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority, she linked up with farms in Pahang that supplied her with fresh fruits, which were then freeze-dried and coated with chocolate in her premises.\nSince that initial order in 2013, freeze-dried fruits has spun off into a profitable secondary line of business.\nAslinah could finally afford to buy her own freeze-drying machine in 2017, when orders exceeded RM80,000 per month.\nLooking ahead\nAzaib currently operates out of two leased facilities. At Kimar, Batu Caves, which also serves as the headquarters, cocoa butter is melted before it is coated around fillings and packed into pouches. The plant in Sungai Buloh focuses on freeze drying fruits both for in-house products and for original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers.\nCombined, the two facilities produce 2 tonnes of chocolate products monthly.\nFrom achieving a modest revenue of RM350,000 in its first year of operation, Azaib is targeting sales of RM3mil in 2019. Export contributes 80% of Azaib\u2019s revenue, with China and Singapore making up its main markets, followed by the Middle East and Asean.\nWhile overseas prospects are bright, Aslinah is keen to widen her products\u2019 local distribution beyond high-end retailers.\n\u201cIn a way, overseas market is simpler because transactions are in cash. All you have to worry about is delivering your goods to the location,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cThe local market involves complex activities like branding, marketing and network building. Getting a trustworthy partner is critical because managing the local market is a completely different ball game.\u201d\nBut having a local presence is important.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re locally strong, it helps with branding because it creates a different kind of visibility, like a premium real estate. For example, I got my first break into China because my chocolates were displayed at Cold Storage,\u201d she says.\nIn between overseeing her operations, strategising her company\u2019s growth and hitting the trade show circuit, Aslinah is also a highly-sought after speaker on the subjects of export market and women entrepreneurship.\nAfter eight years in the industry, she has learned valuable lessons and thinks she has something to offer new entrepreneurs, including her take on what they should do, what kind of market research to conduct and where to get certification.\n\u201cI love to mentor young entrepreneurs and help them grow,\u201d says the eldest of five siblings.\nAslinah describes her parents as her greatest strength. She credits her father, a company driver, for instilling the value of diligence and her mother, a homemaker, for educating her on financial smarts.\n\u201cPeople are amazed at how my parents could send all their children to college and buy a double-storey house on a driver\u2019s salary. Mum was a financial whiz, always reminding us to save money, avoid debt and invest in assets. Sometimes, she would even eat our leftover food to avoid waste.\u201d\nHer company\u2019s name, Azaib, and her chocolate brand, Malsa, are in honour of her parent; they are her mother\u2019s name and an inversion of her father\u2019s name, respectively.\n\u201cI am who I am because of them. It\u2019s the least I can do to show my gratitude.\u201d\nRelated story:\nIngredients for success\n    Related News\nSMEBIZ18 Mar 2019\nIngredients for success\nSMEBIZ04 Feb 2019\nFestive boost expected for retailers\nSMEBIZ21 Jan 2019\nEye on the European market"

An infrastructure blitz that takes Thailand\u2019s economy to new heights.\n\nThat\u2019s the vision of the Thai military junta, which has ruled the Southeast Asian nation since seizing control in a coup in 2014, and is now looking to bring its leader, Prayuth Chan-Ocha, back as prime minister in the March 24 election.\n\nIts economic plan rests on a 1.7 trillion baht ($54 billion) spending push to revive competitiveness in an economy hamstrung by depressed business confidence and investment. Growth has lagged peers in the region, productivity has weakened and companies have been reluctant to invest in an environment of trade tensions and political uncertainty.\n\nThe return of democracy comes with its own risks: a possible messy exit from five years of repressive military rule that is clouding the economic outlook.\n\nThailand\u2019s establishment elites have dueled for power with the populist alliance of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra for over a decade, a fault line that could bring gridlock to the next parliament. He or his supporters prevailed in each election since 2001, only to be unseated by the military or the courts.\n\nThe instability has weighed on competitiveness and investment, both of which the junta has struggled to turn around since taking power.\n\n\u201cImproving national competitiveness is super urgent,\u201d said Somprawin Manprasert, the chief economist at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, a Thai unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. \u201cThailand can ill-afford another period of lagging behind from political disorder.

            "Content": "Learning from others: Aslinah participates in trade shows to learn new trends in the market.\nPEOPLE often do a double-take when they find out Aslinah Aslam\u2019s age when she founded Azaib Holdings \u2013 she was 25 years old. They are even more surprised to know that she started her chocolate manufacturing company with no practical business experience.\nWhat Aslinah lacked in experience, however, she more than made up in \u201crempuh spirit\u201d, as she calls it.\n\u201cIn my early days, if phone calls and emails got me nowhere, I would personally turn up at the reception armed with product samples and my company profile. In business, you must follow up, push and rempuh (charge aggressively) till you break through!\u201d\nThis never-say-die attitude has propelled the company\u2019s growth from a home-based startup to an international player in less than a decade. Azaib has carved a distinctive niche with its Belgian chocolate-covered freeze-dried tropical fruits.\nAslinah\u2019s foray into business was sparked by a weekend project helping an entrepreneur friend.\nThen working as a bank officer, she found the experience of meeting a variety of interesting people completely different from sitting in an office processing documents.\n\u201cI told myself, someday, I\u2019ll be an entrepreneur too.\u201d\nWhen her employer offered a Voluntary Separation Scheme in 2009, Aslinah saw the opportunity to put her plan in motion.\nFrozen fruits: Workers manning the machine, which freeze-dries fruits for in-house products and OEM customers.\n\u201cI figured the severance package would come in handy as seed capital for my business venture, whatever that might be,\u201d she says.\nWhile scouting for opportunities, she heard that airport duty-free retailer Eraman was looking for a local chocolate supplier to showcase a Malaysian brand alongside their imported brands.\nAslinah happened to be a skilled baker whose creations, including chocolate, were a hit with family and friends.\nAfter surveying the market, she brainstormed furiously to distinguish her product from the ones on offer. Her praline confections, sold under the Malsa brand, beat out three other competitors and won her an initial order of RM40,000.\nWith an order in hand, Aslinah needed a proper production facility; doing it in her family kitchen was out of the question. Friends pointed her to the National Cocoa Board, which had an incubator programme to help budding chocolate entrepreneurs.\nAslinah went ahead and rented its facilities in Nilai, which provide product development trial services for pre-commercialisation purposes, although it was a long drive from home.\n\u201cSince we could only use the facilities from 8am-5pm, I had to leave home at 5.30am so that I can maximise my time. If I\u2019m late, rugi-lah. We do the production as fast as we can. Eat lunch also cepat-cepat, 10-15 minutes in rotation,\u201d she shares.\nShe also rented a friend\u2019s factory which had different machines.\n\u201cMy friend\u2019s factory could produce praline chocolates, heart-shaped and flower-shaped chocolates, while the Nilai facilities had bigger machines that could produce round-shaped chocolates in higher volumes.\u201d\nEven with all that going on, Aslinah made time to travel to Belgium for R&D purposes.\n\u201cI knew I had to upgrade my skills and continuously improve my recipe. What better way than to visit and learn from the top factories in the country synonymous with quality chocolates?\u201d\nHer unrelenting focus on perfectionism paid off in 2012, when a customer bought her products off the shelves from Cold Storage. The customer, an international trader, was so impressed that she tracked Aslinah down and offered her the opportunity to supply to China.\nThus, Aslinah snagged her first overseas order of RM150,000.\nNo guts, no glory\nWhile luck played a role in the company\u2019s expansion, a deciding factor in Azaib\u2019s story is its founder\u2019s initiative.\nAslinah recalls the time she sealed her spot in a Matrade\u2019s women entrepreneurs programme.\n\u201cI was a nobody then. But when I spotted the CEO in the canteen, I brazenly walked up to him and told him I\u2019m a growing SME who just broke into the China market, and needed support to expand. I told him, \u2018I have applied for the women entrepreneurs\u2019 programme, can you please look at it?\u2019\u201d\nThe reward for a thick skin was priceless.\n\u201cThe programme gave us the opportunity to attend international trade shows, where we learn about pricing, sampling, marketing, quality standards, negotiation skills, which markets are hot, what\u2019s the next big thing. I found the learning so invaluable that even after the programme, I allocate a part of my annual budget for trade shows because I believe the investment is worth it,\u201d she says.\nHer participation in a trade show in Thailand in 2012 led her to what eventually became her core product.\nShe noticed that the Thais were promoting their local fruits aggressively and a light bulb went off in her head \u2013 why not incorporate tropical fruits into chocolate products? Malaysia had a wealth of delicious fruits that would complement chocolates, and more importantly, give her brand a unique selling point to stand out in the competitive landscape.\nUnfortunately, she hit a stone wall. Commercial freeze-drying technology was not yet widely available in Malaysia and buying a machine, costing over RM1mil, was not a viable option.\nIf she wanted to go ahead with her plan, she would have to source freeze-dried fruits from outside Malaysia.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about it but I had to act on the opportunity while I had first mover advantage,\u201d she admits.\nAzaib shipped out its first batch of chocolate-wrapped fruits in 2012 using imported freeze-fried fruits.\nA year later, Aslinah received a big order from China for freeze-dried durian. Fortunately, by then, she had also found a local company with freeze-drying facilities.\n\u201cIt was uncharted territory, but I thought the risk was worth taking because the freeze dried fruits could be used for our chocolates too. I was excited that I now had a real chance to support local farmers,\u201d she says.\nWith help from the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority, she linked up with farms in Pahang that supplied her with fresh fruits, which were then freeze-dried and coated with chocolate in her premises.\nSince that initial order in 2013, freeze-dried fruits has spun off into a profitable secondary line of business.\nAslinah could finally afford to buy her own freeze-drying machine in 2017, when orders exceeded RM80,000 per month.\nLooking ahead\nAzaib currently operates out of two leased facilities. At Kimar, Batu Caves, which also serves as the headquarters, cocoa butter is melted before it is coated around fillings and packed into pouches. The plant in Sungai Buloh focuses on freeze drying fruits both for in-house products and for original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers.\nCombined, the two facilities produce 2 tonnes of chocolate products monthly.\nFrom achieving a modest revenue of RM350,000 in its first year of operation, Azaib is targeting sales of RM3mil in 2019. Export contributes 80% of Azaib\u2019s revenue, with China and Singapore making up its main markets, followed by the Middle East and Asean.\nWhile overseas prospects are bright, Aslinah is keen to widen her products\u2019 local distribution beyond high-end retailers.\n\u201cIn a way, overseas market is simpler because transactions are in cash. All you have to worry about is delivering your goods to the location,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cThe local market involves complex activities like branding, marketing and network building. Getting a trustworthy partner is critical because managing the local market is a completely different ball game.\u201d\nBut having a local presence is important.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re locally strong, it helps with branding because it creates a different kind of visibility, like a premium real estate. For example, I got my first break into China because my chocolates were displayed at Cold Storage,\u201d she says.\nIn between overseeing her operations, strategising her company\u2019s growth and hitting the trade show circuit, Aslinah is also a highly-sought after speaker on the subjects of export market and women entrepreneurship.\nAfter eight years in the industry, she has learned valuable lessons and thinks she has something to offer new entrepreneurs, including her take on what they should do, what kind of market research to conduct and where to get certification.\n\u201cI love to mentor young entrepreneurs and help them grow,\u201d says the eldest of five siblings.\nAslinah describes her parents as her greatest strength. She credits her father, a company driver, for instilling the value of diligence and her mother, a homemaker, for educating her on financial smarts.\n\u201cPeople are amazed at how my parents could send all their children to college and buy a double-storey house on a driver\u2019s salary. Mum was a financial whiz, always reminding us to save money, avoid debt and invest in assets. Sometimes, she would even eat our leftover food to avoid waste.\u201d\nHer company\u2019s name, Azaib, and her chocolate brand, Malsa, are in honour of her parent; they are her mother\u2019s name and an inversion of her father\u2019s name, respectively.\n\u201cI am who I am because of them. It\u2019s the least I can do to show my gratitude.\u201d\nRelated story:\nIngredients for success\n    Related News\nSMEBIZ18 Mar 2019\nIngredients for success\nSMEBIZ04 Feb 2019\nFestive boost expected for retailers\nSMEBIZ21 Jan 2019\nEye on the European market"

            "Content": "AFTER Khazanah Nasional Bhd\u2019s partial divestment in IHH Healthcare Bhd , there are at least six locally-listed companies which could see a reduction in shareholding by the sovereign wealth fund (SWF).\nThe fund owns substantial stakes in some of Malaysia\u2019s largest companies, including banking group CIMB Group Holdings Bhd , Axiata Group Bhd , UEM Sunrise Bhd and UEM Edgenta Bhd .\nThese companies were previously core holdings but have now been placed under the fund\u2019s \u201ccommercial\u201d pool of assets.\nPut in a nutshell, the commercial pool of assets are up for divestment for the right price.\nThis is evident from Khazanah managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan\u2019s recent media interview where he envisaged 70% of the fund\u2019s assets being placed in the commercial basket.\nHe has indicated that it would no longer look to hold onto its large stakes in these companies, feeling more comfortable in whittling them down when opportunities arise.\nThe remaining 30% of its assets would be companies that have \u201cstrategic\u201d roles such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd , Tenaga Nasional Bhd , Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and Malaysia Airlines Bhd.\nIn November last year, Khazanah sold a 16% stake in IHH to Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM6 per share in a deal valued at RM8.42bil. That transaction effectively kicked off Khazanah\u2019s divestment strategy because IHH was previously considered a core holding for the SWF.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nInvestment , Malaysia Banking Merger , CIMB , RHB , Khazanah , EPF\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

            "date": "Saturday, 3 Feb 2018",
            "time": "",
            "Content": "LAST year was dotted by the return of higher commodity prices and better economic growth. The world\u2019s economies on average are back in business as growth rates and trade have started to improve once again after some period of uncertainty caused by a cooling China economy and also the slump in global crude oil prices.\nThat translated to indeed a stellar year for Malaysia\u2019s richest people. The top 40 richest Malaysians saw their net worth increase by a combined RM63.62bil or 28% to RM290.48bil at the end of 2017.\nThat amount though is limited to the value of listed shares the 40 individuals own and do not take into account the debt taken to buy the shares and the information gathered is based on latest disclosures made by those companies as at the end of last year.\nAmong the richest 40, the person who saw the largest increase in wealth was Robert Kuok. Malaysia\u2019s richest man who saw a RM13.17bil increase in his wealth and that was followed by Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd founder Tan Sri Koon Poh Keong and Koon Poh Ming, who is his brother.\nThe rebound in aluminium prices and the great improvement in the financial performance of Press Metal led to a huge rise in wealth for Poh Keong and Poh Ming, and subsequently their ranking from the 14th spot to eighth this year.\nThis year also saw the entry of seven new people into the list, led by Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranun of the AirAsia Group. The big jump in the share price of AirAsia as the profits of the company soared amid an internal restructuring of the group saw them catapult into the 17th position with a combined wealth of RM3.95bil.\nOther notable entries into the list with wealth in excess of RM2bil are Datuk Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah, Abdul Kadier Sahib and Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd (RM2.5bil) and fund manager Datuk Seri Cheah Cheng Hye (RM2.47bil) of Value Partners Group.\nBut with every entry into the list, there is an equal number of individuals who have dropped out of the top 40. Tan Sri Shahril Shamsuddin of Sapura Energy Bhd was ranked the 29th richest person in Malaysia in 2016 but the collapse in crude oil prices and also the share price of his listed company saw him lose more than half of the value of his shares in the company.\nThe drop in the share price of Sapura Energy erased RM958mil in the value of Shahril\u2019s shares in the company.\nOther notable people who have dropped out of the top 40 are Rimbunan Hijau boss Tan Sri Diong Hiew King @ Tiong Hiew King and Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir after he sold his listed shares in Sapura Energy.\n1. ROBERT KUOK\nFlagship: PPB Group Bhd/Kerry\nGroup net worth: RM49.9bil\nMALAYSIANS know Robert Kuok as the country\u2019s richest man, and for a very long time too. His wealth, estimated at nearly RM50bil at the end of 2017, is more than double the next name on the list of the country\u2019s richest people. But last year, the legendary 94-year-old multi-billionaire did something many have been waiting for.\nKuok is reclusive. He is still sharp of mind when it comes to running his business empire and by publishing his memoir, a lot of the whispers, legend and rumours about his life were corrected or validated in some way. In fact, he let on more than what people knew about his journey in life and business, and understandably, the book was sold out as fast as any book could have in this part of the world.\nHis influence is well-documented. Kuok was the trailblazer who opened his doors to China, and in return, made money for generations to come.\nKuok\u2019s wealth at the end of 2017 was RM49.9bil, but in a year that was dotted by the return of high commodity prices and economic growth in this part of the world, Kuok made more money than any of the other billionaires on the list.\nThe rich do get richer and Kuok made RM13.2bil last year, or a 35.9% increase from the RM36.7bil he was worth at the end of 2016. That increase alone is equal to what the eighth-richest man in Malaysia was worth last year.\nKuok has controlling stakes in three listed companies in Malaysia \u2013 PPB Group Bhd, Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd (Maybulk) and Shangri-La Hotels (M) Bhd. PPB is a diversified company that is in plantations, food and also cinemas through Golden Screen Cinema Sdn Bhd. Maybulk is a shipping line and Shangri-La Hotels is the No 1 hotel chain in the country.\nHis businesses in Malaysia are a big part of his wealth, but the majority comes from his listed companies in Hong Kong and Singapore through Wilmar International Ltd.\nThrough a web of shareholding structures, Kuok\u2019s wealth is primarily held by Hong Kong-based Kerry Group. Kerry Group has stakes in Hong Kong-listed entities such as Shangri-La Asia, Kerry Properties and Kerry Logistics.\nIt was the big rise in the share prices of Kerry Properties and Shangri-La Asia that fuelled the big jump in Kuok\u2019s wealth last year. Kerry Properties\u2019 share price rose nearly 70% last year, while the value of Shangri-La Asia more than doubled in a single year.\n2. TAN SRI LIM KOK THAY\nFlagship: Genting Group\nGroup net worth: RM23.8bil\nTAN SRI Lim Kok Thay has turned the Genting Group from a one-hill casino wonder to an international gaming and entertainment company. The 65-year-old tycoon inherited the business empire built by his father and took it beyond the local shores in a far bigger way than the group had ever done.\nThe Malaysian operations are still the foundation of a group that now has diversified from being just a leisure and hospitality company. Plantations, property development and even biotechnology are areas that matter to the group that is ranked among the world\u2019s biggest hospitality companies.\nWith Genting Highlands still a linchpin for the group and the foundation of its global success, the Genting Integrated Tourism Plan, handled through subsidiary Genting Malaysia Bhd, has developed and launched new tourism facilities that will be a source of long-term growth for the group.\nWork on a 20th Century Fox theme park is well underway and that will seal Genting Malaysia\u2019s appeal as a huge tourism site, and last year, the group announced the development of its Resorts World New York City. The US$400mil expansion at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, New York, is set to become the Genting Group\u2019s long-run growth engine.\nGenting Singapore\u2019s share price was up about 45% last year and Genting Bhd\u2019s stock was higher by about 15%.\nHis wealth grew by 7.2% last year to RM23.8bil from RM22.2bil in 2016 and the most significant development for him was asserting control over the Genting Group by declaring that he is a major shareholder of the group with direct and indirect stakes totalling 44.38%.\nHis announcement in November came after a report inferred that Lim may not be a substantial shareholder of the diversified group.\n3. TAN SRI TEH HONG PIOW\nFlagship: Public Bank Bhd\nGroup net worth: RM21.6bil\nUNLIKE the others ahead of him in the ranking of the richest people in the country, Teh has been a one-man show who built his wealth through the financial sector. The founder of Public Bank has been largely absent from the public eye for some time, as the 88-year-old banker juggles his time between the office and nurturing his health.\nBut the bank seems to be ageing like fine wine, going from strength to strength as its share price hit a record high in 2017.\nTeh\u2019s wealth increased by 6% last year to RM21.6bil from RM20.3bil in 2016. The rise has been pinned to Public Bank\u2019s strong financial performance which posted a net profit of RM1.4bil in the third quarter. For the nine-month period, Public Bank also increased its dividend a notch to 27 sen a share from 26 sen a share last year.\nIt is such generous dividends over the years, along with the steady rise in profitability, that has made Public Bank shareholders beam. The one statistic the bank always releases is shareholder returns and in its latest annual report, it showed that a shareholder who had bought 1,000 Public Bank shares in 1967 (the year the bank was listed) and held on to them, would be holding 148,938 shares as at end-2016 valued at RM2.94mil.\nIn addition, that shareholder would have received total gross dividends of RM1.2mil.\nThe other big development last year was Teh\u2019s announcement that he would be taking a backseat in January 2019 when he retires as chairman come that year.\nHe will remain as the bank\u2019s adviser and assume the title of \u201cchairman emeritus\u201d in recognition of his contributions to the bank he founded at the age of 35 in 1965. The bank\u2019s shares hardly reacted, as the announcement of Teh\u2019s departure ahead of the real schedule underlines the strategy of the banking group in putting in place a succession plan and making it public.\n4. TAN SRI LEE SHIN CHENG\nFlagship: IOI Corp Bhd\nGroup net worth: RM20.6bil\nIOI CORP has been the stellar plantation company for the longest time, as the group has had a phenomenal record of delivering growth organically and via acquisitions. By acquiring estates from the 1990s, IOI Corp has grown in size and profit, which has made Lee one of the country\u2019s richest men.\nFor the 79-year-old planter who claims to be able to talk to oil palm trees, Lee\u2019s plantations are said to have one of the best yields in the business. Its sprawling plantation empire is also complemented by the property business through IOI Properties Group Bhd that saw his wealth increasing by 8.4% last year to RM20.6bil from RM19bil.\nIOI Properties is also one of the largest property companies in the country and its strength is its overseas exposure that has helped buffer revenue and profit away from solely the Malaysian market.\nIt has bought properties in Xiamen, China, and also Singapore and those properties delivered big returns, as IOI Properties in the first quarter of its financial year posted a 28.1% year-on-year jump in net profit to RM242.85mil.\nBut the stalwart of its business is plantations, and last year, IOI announced the proposed disposal of a 70% controlling stake in IOI\u2019s Netherlands-based palm oil refinery IOI Loders Croklaan Group BV for RM3.94bil to Bunge while retaining a 30% stake in Loders.\nLoders is one of Europe\u2019s leading global suppliers of specialty oils and fats to the processed food industry. IOI bought this business from Unilever in November 2002 for RM814mil.\nThe disposal of the 70% stake in the oleochemical company will help to pare down the debt of IOI Corp and give it the cash to not only make a special dividend that the market is expecting, but also channel more funds to look to increase the size of its plantation business which has been delivering stellar returns of late.\nThe group is looking to invest RM1bil in plantations after spending substantially in the downstream businesses over the past few years.\n5. T. ANANDA KRISHNAN\nFlagship: Usaha Tegas Sdn Bhd\nGroup net worth : RM20.4bil\nAFTER A big decline in his net worth in 2016, Ananda saw an increase of 2.5% to RM20.4bil from RM19.9bil in 2016, a gain of RM500mil from a year earlier. The increase was the smallest of any tycoon on the top-10 list of the richest people in Malaysia, as a lot of that gain, at least in percentage terms, was given by Ananda\u2019s stake in oil and gas (O&G) company Bumi Armada Bhd.\nThe rebound in crude oil prices lifted sentiment in a number of O&G stocks and it was no different with Bumi Armada. The near 30% increase in market capitalisation of that company lifted Ananda\u2019s wealth, while the other two heavyweight companies that he owns, Maxis Bhd and Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, were either flat or up marginally.\nMaxis is the source of much of Ananda\u2019s wealth and the issues with the company in the past seem to have been ironed out last year, as the telco rebounded strongly in terms of profitability.\nIn the third quarter of its current financial year, Maxis posted a net profit of RM554mil from RM503mil in the previous corresponding period. For the nine-month period, its profit was up to RM1.63bil from RM1.51bil previously.\nAstro, however, saw a dip in its profit in the third quarter although its profit for the nine-month period was higher than a year ago. While Astro stands to benefit from higher advertising expenditure and average revenue per user, there are risks to its business from rising content cost and a decline in pay-TV subscribers.\nThe year also saw the reported departure of his long-time lieutenant Ralph Marshall, who along with the 80-year-old Ananda is continuing to see protracted issues with a legal case in India.\nAlthough his wealth is based on his stakes in Malaysian listed companies, sentiment from ongoing troubles in India will affect opinions on Ananda. But he recently received a bit of good news in India, as bankers have agreed to swap debt into equity in the debt restructuring of his mobile network Aircel.\n6. TAN SRI LAU CHO KUN\nFlagship: Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd\nGroup net worth: RM17.6bil\nTHE Sabah-based tycoon saw a RM1.17bil increase in his net worth to RM17.6bil from RM16.4bil in 2016, and much of that is down to a stellar performance of Hap Seng Consolidated shares last year.\nThe performance of the company\u2019s share price over the past few years shows a steady upward trajectory that is underpinned by an equally calculated rise in the profitability of the group. The group, for the nine months to end-September last year, posted a net profit of RM1bil from RM962mil in the previous period. Cho Kun is the nephew of the late Tan Sri Lau Gek Poh and much of the business is run by professional managers.\nCho Kun is the largest shareholder in Hap Seng with a 73.9% stake by virtue of the family\u2019s stake in Gek Poh Group and Lei Shing Hong Investments.\nAlthough Hap Seng is the largest independent distributor of Mercedes-Benz cars in Asia, which is run through the private family business, the diversified listed group on Bursa Malaysia has interests in plantations, building materials, fertilisers, automotive distribution and credit financing and has been busy in recent years.\nDuring the year, Hap Seng was reported to have proposed to sell subsidiary Hap Seng Logistics Sdn Bhd to LSH Logistics Pvt Ltd for RM750mil and sell 10 acres of land in Tawau, Sabah for RM175.28mil to Hong Kong-based Lei Shing Hong Ltd.\nIts subsidiary, Malaysian Mosaics Sdn Bhd, proposed to sell a parcel of leasehold land and buildings in Kluang, Johor to Byorion Sdn Bhd for RM97.5mil.\nHap Seng controls 53% of Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd and 25% in Paos Holdings Bhd \u2013 a soap manufacturer where it is the second-largest shareholder.\nAs for the property business, Hap Seng has launched Hap Seng 3, a new tower in the heart of Kuala Lumpur for an estimated RM312mil. The 26-storey project is scheduled to be completed in 2019.\n7. TAN SRI QUEK LENG CHAN\nFlagship: Hong Leong\nGroup net worth: RM15.9bil\nThe 75-year old tycoon has substantial stake in arguably the most number of listed companies with 16 spread through jurisdictions in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nFor his myriad of companies that he owns and controls, Quek\u2019s varied interests also saw him reap the benefit of having a financial-services spine in his business empire flanked by many cyclical-based industries such a technology and property development.\n\nQuek saw his net worth rise by 17.7% or RM2.39bil to RM15.94bil from RM13.54bil.\n\nIn Malaysia, Quek\u2019s prized-asset remains his stake in Hong Leong Bank Bhd, which he owns through Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (HLFG). The market capitalisation of Hong Leong Bank at the end of 2017 was RM36.85bil of which HLFG owns a 62% stake in.\n\nQuek, through Hong Leong Company (Malaysia) Bhd, controls 75.6% stake in Guoco Hong Kong, which holds a 25.4% stake in HLFG. HLFG, in turn, has a direct 62% stake in Hong Leong Bank and 81.3% in Hong Leong Capital Bhd.\n\nWith the impending retirement of Tan Sri The Hong Piow as chairman of Public Bank, Quek will be the last individual shareholder who is allowed to hold such a large stake in a Malaysian bank under the grandfather clause.\n\nDuring the year, HLFG and Hong Leong Bank have proposed that over a 30-year period from when the first securities are issued, up to RM25bil in funding may be raised under this programme. HLFG and HLB are already capitalised well above \n\nBank Negara regulatory capital requirements, and the note programme is to provide against future needs.\n\nQuek also controls London-listed gaming outfit Rank Group plc and has a 13.4% stake in Bank of East Asia of Hong Kong.\n  8. TAN SRI KOON POH KEONG and KOON POH MING\nFlagship: Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM13.07bil\nLAST year saw Press Metal Aluminium Holdings\u2019 share price surging some 200% year-on-year, bolstering the Koon family\u2019s wealth to RM13.07bil from RM3.71bil in 2016; and catapulting their position to eighth place on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list in 2017, up from the 14th spot in the preceding year.\nAs at Dec 31, 2017, Poh Keong, the company\u2019s group chief executive officer, had a 17.3% stake in Press Metal, while his brother, Poh Ming, had an 8.4% stake in the company.\nAlpha Milestone Sdn Bhd, the vehicle of Poh Keong and Poh Ming, had a 22.3% stake in Press Metal as at Dec 31, 2017.\nAluminium prices have since rebounded to hover around US$2,200 (RM8,500) per tonne, following a temporary blip in early December 2017.\nA graduate in electrical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in the United States, the 57-year-old Poh Keong formed the company as an aluminium-extruding operation in 1986 \u2013 employing just 12 workers. Press Metal today has grown into a globally integrated aluminium corporation.\nThe company has a downstream extrusion operation that is integrated with its greenfield aluminium-smelting plants in Mukah and Samalaju in Sarawak, which have an annual combined capacity of 760,000 tonnes per annum \u2013 which is 1.3% of global aluminium consumption.\nPart of the rise of Press Metal\u2019s share price is the profit it makes from the aluminium business, thanks to a long-term cheap power deal to buy energy from Bakun Dam. Press Metal is said to be the single largest buyer of power from the dam.\nThe company also operates aluminium extrusion plants in Malaysia and China. Press Metal\u2019s market capitalisation stood at RM20.7bil as at Dec 31, 2017.\nPress Metal\u2019s cumulative nine-month core profit ended Sept 30, 2017 rose 57.3% to RM452.6mil from RM287.7mil a year ago.\nThe increase was mainly due to additional production output generated by its Samalaju Phase 2 smelting plant and higher metal prices.\nCumulative nine-month revenue was up 30.1% to RM6bil from the preceding year\u2019s nine-month revenue of RM4.6bil. The company is targeting to increase the contribution of value-added products from 30% to 50% by end-2018.\n9. KUAN KAM HON @ KWAN KAM ONN\nFlagship: Hartalega Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM9.71bil\nKUAN is best known for his flagship Hartalega Holdings \u2013 where he is executive chairman.\nAs at Dec 31, 2017, he had a 6% direct stake in Hartalega Holdings and an indirect stake of 49% via outfit Hartalega Industries.\nShares of Hartalega Holdings rose some 124% in 2017, raising Kuan\u2019s position to ninth on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list in 2017 from 11th the previous year, and more than doubling his net worth year-on-year to RM9.71bil last year from RM4.44bil in 2016.\nThe company\u2019s market cap stood at RM17.65bil as at Dec 31, 2017.\nAnalysts have noted, however, that it would be challenging for the glovemaker to deliver a similar above 50% growth rate in financial year 2019, as the group is already running at full capacity and margin expansion estimates would not be as significant as in 2018.\nBased on reports, Hartalega Holdings\u2019 plants were operating at utilisation rates of more than 90% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThis is close to its maximum capacity and above its historical average of 85%-88%.\nA self-made tycoon, Kuan, 71, founded the company in the early 1980s and was instrumental in growing it to become the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and distributor of nitrile gloves.\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and distributor of nitrile gloves, with an infrastructure currently built to support the production of 30 billion gloves per year.\nThe company operates from two main sites \u2013 five plants at Bestari Jaya spanning an area of 37 acres; and six plants to be commissioned at Sepang, called Hartalega Next Generation Complex, encompassing an area of 112 acres, which upon its completion would be capable of boosting group total production capacity to 42 billion gloves annually.\nTheir dedicated production lines aggregating to 117 lines in total are designed in-house, applying custom-built and cutting-edge technologies to serve the global market with speed, efficiency and quality.\n10. TAN SRI DR CHEN LIP KEONG\nFlagship: NagaCorp\nNet worth: RM9.31bil\nA MEDICAL doctor by training, Chen made his fortune through the gaming and tourism business.\nLast year, the 71-year-old saw his net worth more than triple to RM9.309bil from RM2.8bil in 2016, catapulting him to the 10th spot on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list in 2017 from the 17th spot in the preceding year.\nChen\u2019s flagship company is NagaCorp Ltd, in which he owns a 65.4% stake. The tycoon also controls Karambunai Corp Bhd, in which he has a 73.4% stake.\nChen also has a 29.7% stake in FACB Industries Incorporated Bhd and an 82.9% stake in Petaling Tin Bhd.\nNagaCorp is the largest hotel, gaming and leisure operator in Cambodia. NagaCorp became the first company with operations in Cambodia to become a public-listed company in Hong Kong, as well as the first gaming-related company traded.\nThe company had a market capitalisation of HK$26.26bil as at end-2017.\nNagaCorp-owned NagaWorld is the only casino-hotel entertainment complex in Phnom Penh and enjoys a 70-year concession on its licence that runs until 2065. The 41-year monopoly of its licence will also see it having a casino monopoly within 200km of Phnom Penh until 2025.\nKarambunai, on the other hand, is involved in the tourism industry in Sabah and property development in Malaysia. The group, which owns 1,300 acres near Putrajaya and the KL International Airport, had a market capitalisation of RM347mil as at end-2017.\nChen\u2019s two other listed companies \u2013 FACB and Petaling Tin \u2013 had smaller market capitalisations of RM126mil and RM130mil, respectively, as at end-2017.\nFACB is a manufacturer of mattresses and steel fittings, while Petaling Tin is involved in property development.\n11 TAN SRI YEOH TIONG LAY\nFlagship: YTL Corp Bhd\nNet worth: RM9.22bil\nTHE late Yeoh, who passed away in October last year at the age of 88, is ranked 11th among Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest people in 2017.\nWith just a secondary school education, Yeoh built his business empire and founded one of Malaysia\u2019s largest conglomerates, YTL Corp.\nThe group has interests in various business segments, spanning over power and water, technology, cement and property, among others.\nYTL Corp surprised the market last year after clinching the construction contract for the Gemas-Johor Baru double-track rail project. Given its inactive status in the local rail scene since its Express Rail Link development back in 1996, the news came as a positive surprise.\nIt has been reported that YTL Corp is also eyeing the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail development, which is slated to commence operations in 2026.\nAnalysts are positive on the group\u2019s renewed interest in the rail segment, which will further elevate its order book.\nThis will likely be positive for YTL Corp\u2019s construction division, which has delivered dismal revenue and earnings in the past few years, according to MIDF Research.\nThe company\u2019s construction division has mainly been boosted by its own pipeline of property development and infrastructure works within the group\u2019s other core activities.\nYTL Corp derives most of its earnings from its utilities business in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and the UK that collectively account for two-thirds of its revenue.\nIts Paka Power Station saw the commencement of supply from September last year under a new power purchase agreement.\nYTL Corp also owns a listed utility arm on Bursa Malaysia, YTL Power International Bhd.\nThe group\u2019s cement manufacturing business, the second-largest revenue contributor, has been affected by competitive pricing and lower demand for cement domestically.\nThe cement business was privatised six years ago in a move to consolidate its business structure to offer better value to shareholders.\nYTL Corp\u2019s hospitality arm, YTL Hotels & Properties Sdn Bhd, continued to expand its footprint in Asia last year.\nThe company partnered with Marriott International Inc to roll out four new hotels \u2013 two of which will be in Kuala Lumpur and another two in Niseko Village, Hokkaido, Japan.\nYTL Hotels and Marriott International have worked together in five to six countries.\nThe Yeoh family, which was led by patriarch Yeoh, owns a 52.7% stake in YTL Corp. Yeoh handed over the reins to Tan Sri Francis Yeoh in 1978.\n12. TAN SRI G GNANALINGAM\nFlagship: Westports Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM5.74bil\nGNANALINGAM, who sat at the tail-end of the top-10 richest people in 2016, has fallen by three notches to No. 12 as of last year.\nHe also saw his net wealth in 2017 declining the most by nearly 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) compared with his peers in 2016\u2019s top-10 richest league. Approximately RM1bil has been erased from his fortune.\nThe significant change in net worth is actually understandable, given the fall in Westports\u2019 share price in recent times.\nIn 2017 alone, the counter depreciated by 12% to RM3.70 per share as at Dec 31, mainly as a result of Westports\u2019 declining container throughput and financial performance.\nBased on this, Gnanalingam\u2019s 45.5% stake is valued at RM5.74bil.\nFrom just a \u201cbarren, swampy island\u201d in 1994, Gnanalingam led Westports to become one of the main hubs serving container traffic along the Straits of Malacca, which is the key shipping route from the west to the east.\nToday, the country\u2019s largest port operator can handle up to 13 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per annum. It is also undergoing continuous expansion to further increase its container handling capacity and cater for its long-term growth.\nCompetitive rates and rising efficiencies are said to be among factors that have lured traffic to its port.\nThe company is currently at the tail-end of its CT1 to CT9 container terminal expansion, and has also received approval-in-principle from the government to develop the CT10 to CT19 container terminals.\nBy 2040, Westports, which was listed on Bursa Malaysia in 2013, aims to more than double its current capacity to 30 million TEUs.\nAn unprecedented realignment of a new global alliance of shipping lines and mergers and acquisitions in the global shipping industry has pulled down Westports\u2019 container throughput since the second quarter of 2017.\nAs a result, the company recorded a container throughput of about nine million TEUs in 2017. The result is within Westports\u2019 volume guidance, lower by between 7% and 12% on a y-o-y basis.\nTo put matters into perspective, Westports\u2019 closest competitor, Northport (M) Bhd, has also experienced lower container volume due to similar reasons.\nCurrently, Westports serves as one of South-East Asia\u2019s transshipment hubs for Ocean Alliance and also as a port of call for a service under THE Alliance.\nLast December, the Ocean Alliance announced the \u201cDay Two Product\u201d, which will see the addition of new services, additional capacity and container ships. The services will start this April and could benefit Westports in the long run.\n13 TAN SRI JEFFREY CHEAH FOOK LING\nFlagship: Sunway Bhd\nNet worth: RM5.5bil\nTHE philanthropist, who saw his fortunes jumping by nearly 29% in 2017, has moved a notch down to the 13th position.\nCheah, the founder and executive chairman of the Sunway group, is seen as a pioneer in higher education and is active in promoting education as a social cause in the country.\nIn 2009, he set up the Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah Foundation, and gifted to it the privately held and cash-rich Sunway education arm.\nThe Sunway Group\u2019s entities comprise flagship Sunway Bhd, which is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia with a market capitalisation of RM8.67bil as at Dec 31, 2017.\nKnown for its iconic property developments, Sunway Bhd has presence in many international markets such as China, Australia and Singapore.\nAt a time when the property sector is slowing down in the region, Sunway Bhd continued to register a resilient financial performance last year.\nSunway Group\u2019s construction arm, Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SunCon), also made headlines in 2017 as it secured major infrastructure contracts.\nThe company, which was listed in 2015, bagged contracts related to the light rail transit line 3, both lines of the mass rapid transit and the proposed 1Malaysia Civil Servants Housing project, among others.\nSunCon\u2019s current order book is valued at RM6.8bil, which offers an earnings visibility for the next three years.\nThe company, via a consortium with IJM Corp Bhd, is also eyeing to become the Malaysian project delivery partner (PDP) for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail development.\nIn the event of the SunCon-IJM consortium securing the PDP role, it could provide a major lift to its bottom line, moving forward.\nApart from its domestic operations, SunCon aims to pursue geographical diversification by enlarging its footprint in the Asean region.\nThe company plans to expand into Myanmar and Indonesia, with special focus on developing infrastructure projects and other specialised buildings such as hospitals.\nAside from Sunway Bhd and SunCon, Sunway Group\u2019s third listed entity is the Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit), with an equity interest of nearly 40%.\nSunway Reit has a coveted portfolio of growing assets, which include Sunway Pyramid, Sunway Carnival Mall and Sunway Putra Hotel.\nAbout 70% of Sunway Reit\u2019s net property income is contributed by retail assets, which enjoy consistent and high occupancy rates.\n14 TAN SRI SYED MOKHTAR ALBUKHARY\nFlagship: MMC Corp Bhd\nNet Worth: RM5.25bil\nSYED MOKHTAR has always been known for having his hands in many businesses. From logistics to utilities to engineering and construction, his business interest spans across different industries.\nIn 2017, the reclusive tycoon dropped out of the top-10 richest list, even as his net worth strengthened by nearly 7% year-on-year.\nSyed Mokhtar\u2019s main listed vehicle is MMC Corp, in which he has an equity interest of 52%.\nWith longstanding experience in the ports business, the conglomerate is continuously expanding its stable of ports.\nCurrently, MMC Corp controls all the ports on the entire west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, namely, the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Johor Port, Penang Port and NCB Holdings Bhd that operates Northport in Port Klang.\nEarlier last year, MMC Ports and India-based Adani Ports partnered to explore the feasibility of the Carey Island Port project as an extension of Port Klang.\nThe announcement came as a major surprise to many, given the already declining container throughput in Port Klang. This was mainly attributed to global shipping alliances shifting operations to Singapore.\nApart from the proposed Carey Island port development, MMC Corp is also in talks with Suria Capital Holdings Bhd to acquire a stake in its wholly owned unit, Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.\nSabah Ports manages and operates eight major ports in Sabah \u2013 four on the west coast, with the rest on the east coast.\nLast year, the group wrested complete control of Penang Port, as it acquired the remaining 51% share in Penang Port Sdn Bhd, the operator of Penang Port.\nOn the construction side, MMC Corp has continued to be involved in key national infrastructure developments.\nCurrently, via a joint-venture with Gamuda Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd, MMC Corp is contending to undertake the mass rapid transit 3 or MRT3 project. Previously, as for MRT1 and MRT2, MMC-Gamuda was appointed as the project delivery partner via direct negotiations.\nIt has also been reported that MMC Corp plans to participate in the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail project in collaboration with a Japanese party.\nSyed Mokhtar\u2019s other listed vehicle is DRB-Hicom Bhd, which made headlines last year following the partial disposal of a stake in carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd.\nChinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd acquired a 49.9% stake in Proton from DRB-Hicom in a move to resuscitate the struggling automobile manufacturer.\nGeely was selected as DRB-Hicom\u2019s strategic partner following an intensive vetting process which included 23 global automotive players.\nAmong other notable assets under DRB-Hicom are Pos Malaysia Bhd and Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd.\n15 TAN SRI LEE OI HIAN & DATUK LEE HAU HIAN\nFlagship: Batu Kawan Bhd\nNet worth: RM4.25bil\nBROTHERS Oi Hian and Hau Hian are perhaps better known for their controlling stake in Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) rather than their flagship entity Batu Kawan Bhd.\nBatu Kawan\u2019s biggest investment is in KLK and it is often seen as a cheaper proxy to KLK.\nWith an equity interest of 46.9%, Batu Kawan is the single largest shareholder in KLK, in which 67-year-old Oi Hian is the chief executive officer. He is also the non-executive chairman of Batu Kawan.\nMeanwhile, 65-year-old Hau Hian is the managing director of Batu Kawan. Both of them are the sons of KLK\u2019s late founder, Tan Sri Lee Loy Seng.\nIn December 2017, KLK announced that it would be acquiring Elementis Specialties Netherlands BV (ESN) in Delden, the Netherlands, for \u20ac39mil (RM187.2mil). ESN, which is primarily involved in surfactant manufacturing, is expected to strengthen KLK\u2019s downstream chemical specialties business in Europe.\nThe takeover is expected to be completed in the first half of this year.\nThe announcement came as positive news, as KLK has long been looking for potential merger and acquisition opportunities.\nIn 2016, the plantation giant made news when it failed in its \u00a3415.4mil (RM2.3bil) takeover to acquire shares of London-listed plantation firm MP Evans Group PLC. The offer lapsed after KLK failed to get the required 50% acceptance level.\nKLK had initially approached MP Evans\u2019 board with an offer price of 640 pence, but later sweetened the offer to 740 pence, a 74% premium to MP Evans\u2019 closing price on Oct 24.\nAs the demand for downstream products is generally more stable, KLK\u2019s acquisition of ESN should help the former mitigate the volatility of crude palm oil (CPO) prices.\nHigher CPO prices throughout last year has led KLK\u2019s plantation segment\u2019s top line to a stronger growth. Overall, the company\u2019s revenue rose by 27.25% y-o-y to RM21bil in that year.\nMoving into 2018, it remains to be seen how KLK will perform financially, amid the higher industry palm oil stockpile and lower expected CPO prices.\nApart from its plantation and oleochemicals business, KLK is also involved in property development.\nDriven by the strategic location of its vast land bank, KLK has developed many projects over the years such as Desa Coalfields, Sierramas and the 1,000-acre Bandar Seri Coalfields.\n16 CHIA SONG KUN AND FAMILY\nFlagship: QL Resources Bhd\nNet worth: RM4.03bil\nCHIA, 68, saw his net worth surging by nearly 30% in 2017, even as he moved a rank down among the top-40 richest Malaysians.\nThis is largely on the back of his family\u2019s flagship company which had a good run last year. The stock rose by 34% last year, driven by its resilient financial performance.\nThe Main Market-listed company currently has a market capitalisation of RM7.7bil.\nFrom its humble beginnings in feedstuff trading, QL Resources has transformed itself into a multinational agro-food corporation.\nEstablished in 1987, QL Resources is now the largest producer of surimi in Asia, as well as the largest fishmeal and surimi-based products manufacturer in Malaysia\nWith operations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and China, QL Resources has been involved in the export of eggs and fisheries products to the neighbouring Asean region and other countries across different continents.\nThe company is also building a presence in the sustainable palm oil sector with activities including milling, plantations and biomass clean energy.\nApart from these business strategies, QL Resources is now positioning itself as the country\u2019s major convenience store operator.\nTwo years ago, the company took the market by surprise by tying up with FamilyMart, the world\u2019s second-largest convenience store chain after 7-Eleven. This is part of QL Resources\u2019 \u201clong-term investment\u201d to expand its food business amid regional economic integration.\nThe agro-food major is now the master franchisee of FamilyMart in Malaysia for the next 20 years and plans to build 60 stores annually between now and 2021.\nCurrently, QL Resources has established 30 FamilyMart stores, with the management guiding that it is likely to open 40-50 stores in the Klang Valley by 2019. The FamilyMart business in Malaysia is expected to breakeven within the next few years\nWith this relatively new venture, QL Resources looks to differentiate itself from its peers by focusing on ready-to-eat meals, currently only available at selected stores in the cities.\nThe Chia family controls 43% of QL Resources through privately-held CBG Holdings Sdn Bhd, with Farsathy Holdings Sdn Bhd owning another 12.1%.\nThe company is noted to be well run with stable earnings.\nQL Resources, via Ruby Technique Sdn Bhd, also has a 5.7% stake in property developer Sunsuria Bhd. The family\u2019s wealth in 2016 was estimated at RM3.1bil.\n17 TAN SRI TONY FERNANDES AND DATUK KAMARUDIN MERANUN\nFlagship: AirAsia Bhd\nNet worth: RM3.95bil\nFernandes and Kamarudin\u2019s names have appeared among the top-40 richest Malaysians on-and-off over the last few years.\nFernandes, the founder of AirAsia Bhd, first broke into the list of billionaires in 2013 with a fortune of RM1.01bil. Last year, he and his long-time business partner, Kamarudin, emerged again in the top-40 richest league.\nBoth of them collectively owned a net worth of close to RM4bil.\nThe sudden surge in their fortunes is undoubtedly because of the share price jump of their flagship in recent times.\nAirAsia made headlines recently with the stock hitting an all-time high earlier this year, as investors may be looking at the possibility of a special dividend following the completion of a share-swap agreement between AirAsia\u2019s ground-handling unit and Singapore\u2019s SATS Ltd.\nLooking back in 2017, the Main Market-listed counter has appreciated strongly by nearly 56%. Currently, its market capitalisation stands at RM14.4bil.\nThe AirAsia Group has been looking at monetising some of its non-core businesses, which may yield additional dividends, apart from one-off gains from the asset disposals.\nLast year, the company sold its entire 50% stake in its joint venture with aviation training provider CAE for US$100mil (RM429.3mil) in a bid to focus on its core business.\nIt has ceded full control of Asian Aviation Centre of Excellence (AACE) to CAE, which will remain as AirAsia Group\u2019s exclusive training partner.\nEstablished in 2011, AACE, formerly known as the AirAsia Academy, was set up to provide aviation-related training services for pilots, cabin crew, maintenance engineers, technicians and ground services personnel.\nApart from that, AirAsia is also looking at hiving off its aircraft leasing unit, Asia Aviation Capital Ltd, which is in its final stage.\nThe sale of the leasing arm is part of the move to streamline the airline\u2019s operations and assets ahead of a reorganisation that will see a holding company, AirAsia Group Bhd, assuming the listing status of AirAsia and including the carrier\u2019s regional associates in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.\nRecently, AirAsia joined the ranks of digital wallet providers with its own app, BigPay.\nFernandes seems to have big plans with the new e-wallet and prepaid card service. He envisages BigPay to be \u201cworth more than AirAsia\u201d in the future.\nThe e-wallet service has the captive audience of the community of AirAsia users. Specifically, the BigPay e-wallet service aims to tap into AirAsia\u2019s database of 63 million passengers.\nBesides their flagship aviation business, Fernandes and Kamarudin also have interests in finance, sports, hospitality, telecoms and education via the Tune Group, which they co-founded in 2001.\n18 TAN SRI LIM WEE CHAI\nFlagship: Top Glove Corp Bhd\nNet worth: RM3.79bil\nWITH a 53% higher net worth, Lim has moved up two notches on the list of 40 richest Malaysians in 2017.\nHis wealth is pretty straightforward and lean. It is through a 36.4% shareholding in Top Glove that Lim owns most of his wealth, as the company is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and distributor of rubber gloves.\nApart from that, he also owns a 10.3% stake in Tropicana Corp Bhd, which is primarily involved in property development.\nFrom just one factory and three production lines during its inception in 1991, Top Glove has now captured 25% of the world market share and offers a diverse product range, which targets both the healthcare and non-healthcare segments.\nCurrently, the glovemaker serves a network of over 2,000 customers in more than 195 countries.\nLast year, the stock had a good run, particularly in the second half of the year as it rose by 55% in 2017. Its market capitalisation stood at RM10bil as at Dec 31, 2017.\nFollowing a long period of speculation in the corporate grapevine, Top Glove announced a few months ago that it would be acquiring Aspion Sdn Bhd from Adventa Capital Pte Ltd via a combination of borrowings and new shares.\nThe proposed deal also comes with Adventa providing a profit after tax guarantee of RM80mil for the financial year ending 2018, translating into a price-to-earnings multiple of 16 to 18 times.\nThe move to acquire Aspion, worth at least RM1.3bil, is said to be one of the biggest investments Top Glove has made since its initial public offering 17 years ago.\nPost-acquisition of Aspion, Top Glove aims to position itself as a global leader in surgical glove manufacturing.\nBeing an export-reliant entity, the volatility in the global currencies, especially the ringgit and the US dollar, has a big influence on Top Glove. The weak ringgit in the past two years has been a boon for Top Glove, as its revenue is predominantly in US dollars terms.\nHowever, with the ringgit gradually strengthening and breaching the RM3.90 per US dollar mark, concerns emerge on whether currency volatility will affect Top Glove, moving forward.\nLim has reportedly said that the strong ringgit is a boon, as it allows the company to proceed with its plans to further expand its production lines, as well as to go for mergers and acquisitions.\nBernama has reported that Top Glove is aiming to acquire between six and seven more companies, moving forward.\n19 WONG THEAN SOON AND DATUK NORRAESAH MOHAMAD\nFlagship: My EG Services Bhd and Excel Force MSC Bhd\nNet worth: RM3.36bil\nWONG Thean Soon or better known as TS Wong in corporate Malaysia, has jumped to the 19th position in 2017, together with his business partner, Norraesah.\nThey are deemed shareholders in MyEG and Excel Force, holding interests in the two listed companies via Asia Internet Holdings Sdn Bhd, Asia Internet E-Services Holdings and Radio Port Ltd.\nMyEG is an e-Government services provider, while Excel Force is into the development, provision and maintenance of computer software application solutions for the stockbroking industry.\nWong, 43, graduated from the National University of Singapore with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering. He has over 20 years of experience in the ICT industry, with his involvement in designing, implementing and the maintenance of communications applications on the Internet in various technology companies, both local and abroad.\nMeanwhile, 69-year-old Norraesah is a former senator and was also chairman of Bank Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia. She emerged as a substantial shareholder in MyEG last year with a 30.41% stake, after she acquired executive director Datuk Raja Munir Shah Raja Mustapha\u2019s stake in Asia Internet Holdings.\nAsia Internet is the single biggest shareholder in MyEG, with 29.9% of MyEG\u2019s issued share capital.\nNorraesah currently serves as MyEG\u2019s executive chairman, while Wong has been the managing director and executive director of MyEG since March 6, 2000.\nEarlier last year, MyEG made its first overseas venture, backed by its infrastructure capacity to set up electronic government services. MyEG inked a joint-venture agreement with I-Pay Commerce Ventures Inc to provide electronic government services in the Philippines and other related services.\nThis includes the provision of other services such as electronic payment in the Philippines.\nIn December 2017, MyEG was also granted a moneylender\u2019s licence by the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry for a period of two years.\nSome 54 property developers in Peninsular Malaysia have money-lending licences to provide loans to home buyers.\nThe licence allows developers to provide bridging loans to house buyers, especially first-timers, to secure end-financing for their property acquisitions.\n20 GOH PENG OOI\nFlagship: Silverlake Axis Ltd\nNet worth: RM2.99bil\nGOH founded Silverlake Axis in 1989 and built the group to become a leading provider of universal banking solutions, with a presence in 20 countries across the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa.\nIt was listed on Singapore Exchange Limited\u2019s (SGX) secondary board Sesdaq in 2003 and moved up to the SGX Main Board in 2011.\nThe 64-year-old Goh, who is Silverlake Axis\u2019 executive chairman, is also known as Malaysia\u2019s very first tech billionaire.\nIn 2017, Goh\u2019s net worth strengthened by nearly 5%, even as he dropped to the 20th rank among the top-40 richest Malaysians.\nOver 40% of the top-20 largest banks in South-East Asia run Silverlake Axis\u2019 core banking solution. Today, Silverlake Axis is the core system platform partner of choice for three of the five largest Asean super regional financial institutions.\nLast year, it was reported that Silverlake Axis was eyeing three Silverlake private entities in Malaysia.\nGoh owns an equity interest of approximately 70% in each of the Silverlake entities \u2013 Silverlake Digital Economy, Silverlake Digitale and Silverlake One Paradigm \u2013 through Silverlake Investment.\nUpon the acquisition, the three companies will effectively become wholly owned subsidiaries of Silverlake Axis. The takeover is aimed at further strengthening Silverlake Axis\u2019 financial technology (fintech) capabilities, and to provide more product offerings in the digital economy.\nAt the end of 2017, Silverlake Axis had a market capitalisation of S$1.52bil and a share price of S$0.58 per unit. The stock has appreciated by 19% throughout the year.\nSilverlake Axis\u2019 financial performance has taken a beating in recent times, as customers deferred and reduced information technology capital expenditures amidst uncertainties in the regional economies.\nHowever, the company remains positive for a better performance moving forward, as customer sentiment improves in tandem with global economic recovery.\nLooking at its balance sheet, Silverlake Axis had a strong net cash position of RM562.4mil as of Sept 30, 2017.\nBacked by this, Silverlake Axis has said that it is evaluating suitable acquisition opportunities to expand its portfolio of fintech and Insuretech software products and services to address the growing demand for transformational digital banking and insurance offerings.\n21 TAN SRI NGAU BOON KEAT\nFlagship: Dialog Group Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.882bil\nTHE co-founder and executive chairman of Dialog saw his net worth rising by more than RM1bil last year, thanks to the recovery in global crude oil prices and increasing jobs from Pengerang, Johor.\nNgau was catapulted to the 21st spot on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list in 2017, up from the 30th spot in the preceding year after his net worth rose 65.5% to RM2.882bil from RM1.741bil in 2016.\nThis was in tandem with the increase in Dialog\u2019s share price, which registered a gain of 65% in 2017 to end at RM2.51, with a market capitalisation of RM14.2bil.\nThe 70-year-old, who co-founded Dialog in 1984, owns a 20.3% stake in the Main Board-listed company that started as an integrated technical services provider to the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors in the oil, gas and petrochemical industry.\nOver the years, Dialog, under Ngau\u2019s leadership, has transformed into a global oil and gas (O&G) services provider specialising in storage tank terminals, engineering services and crude refining facility with presence across Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and UAE.\nThe location of the deepwater terminal in Pengerang has placed Dialog in a position to tap into a market that includes multinational oil majors, national oil companies as well as multinational engineering and services providers worldwide.\nNgau\u2019s ambitious foray to build a deepwater oil-services hub in Pengerang, Johor started several years ago. His vision was to build an O&G deepwater storage terminal and position it as Asia\u2019s version of the Rotterdam Port.\nDialog will remain busy with work in the Pengerang deepwater terminal associated with the handling, storage and distribution of crude oil and byproducts of the refinery and petrochemicals integrated development complex for the next few years.\n22 DATUK LIM KUANG SIA\nFlagship: Kossan Holdings\nNet worth: RM2.663bil\nLAST year was a good one for rubber glove manufacturers on robust demand growth and lower pricing competition.\nKossan Rubber Industries Bhd benefited from the improved sentiment with its share price rising 26% to close at RM8.11 as at end-2017, with a market capitalisation of RM5.186bil.\nAnd Kossan managing director and executive officer Datuk Lim Kuang Sia became the 22nd richest man in Malaysia in 2017, with a net worth of RM2.663bil, based on his and his family\u2019s shareholding in the company.\nIn 2016, Kuang Sia was ranked as the 25th richest person in the country with a net worth of RM2bil.\nKuang Sia, 66, founded Kossan in 1979.\nHe and his family members \u2013 Lim Kuang Wang, Lim Kuang Yong, Lim Kwan Hwa and Lim Leng Bung \u2013 are major shareholders of the group through Kossan Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd, which has a 51.1% stake in Kossan. On top of that, Kuang Sia and his family also have a direct 0.3% share in Kossan.\nKossan is one of Malaysia\u2019s top-four manufacturers that control the world market for gloves. Its products are sold in over 160 countries, and virtually every hospital or medical clinic in the world would have used the company\u2019s products.\nIt is the world\u2019s second-largest manufacturer of disposable latex gloves.\nThe group churns out more than 22 billion pairs of disposable gloves every year. Its product mix is 70% nitrile and 30% natural rubber gloves.\nKossan is expected to add two new plants in 2018, with a total capacity of 4.5 billion gloves per annum. The first new plant is slated for completion by the first quarter of 2018 and the second plant will begin operations in the third quarter of 2018.\n23 DATUK MOHD ABDUL KARIM ABDULLAH, ABDUL KADIER SAHIB AND DATUK AWANG DAUD AWANG PUTERA\nFlagship: Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.499bil\nTHE listing of oil and gas (O&G) engineering services provider Serba Dinamik in February 2017 saw three individuals becoming new entrants to Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list.\nAs the three biggest shareholders in Serba Dinamik, Datuk Mohd Abdul Karim Abdullah, Abdul Kadier Sahib and Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera gained a net worth of RM2.499bil as at Dec 31, 2017, following the listing of the company.\nThat made them the 23rd richest persons in Malaysia last year.\nConsider the rise of Serba Dinamik \u2013 from an offer price of RM1.50, the company\u2019s share price more than doubled to RM3.24 by the end of 2017, giving it a market capitalisation of RM4.325bil.\nKarim, 53, is Serba Dinamik\u2019s group managing director/group chief executive officer (CEO).\nAn engineer by training, he founded Serba Dinamik in June 1993, and currently owns a 25.3% stake in the company. Kadier, 69, a non-executive director of Serba Dinamik, owns a 20.8% stake in the company.\nHe became a shareholder of Serba Dinamik in October 1994 shortly after being appointed as the company\u2019s director in July that year.\nAwang Daud, 57, has an interest of 11.7% in Serba Dinamik.\nHe was appointed as executive director and deputy CEO of the company on May 31, 2016.\nHe joined Serba Dinamik in 1994 as a director and was involved in field supervision, coordination and managing various projects, construction and fabrication tasks, planning and tendering, attending negotiation and handling managerial portfolios.\nSerba Dinamik provides engineering solutions to the O&G and power-generation industries with operational facilities in Malaysia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and the United Kingdom.

He took over the position from his son Datuk Seri Robin Tan Yeong Ching, 43, who will remain as the group\u2019s CEO.\nVincent\u2019s return to BCorp came at a time when the group was facing a challenging operating environment.\nBCorp returned to the black in the financial year ended April 30, 2017, but it was not out of the woods yet based on the loss attributable to shareholders of RM43.4mil reported for the first quarter of this financial year.\nDuring Vincent\u2019s five-year-plus hiatus from the board, he had embarked on various charitable and social programmes and initiatives. However, he had also continued to explore new business opportunities for the BCorp group as its founder and adviser.\nVincent is close to Johor Ruler Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar.\nSultan Ibrahim owns shares in several companies in which Vincent is the major shareholder.

It also boasts a property development portfolio that goes along with the construction business the company was founded on.\nWCT has been eyeing the listing of its REIT, which has been postponed several times.\nFor the REIT listing, WCT is targeting to inject RM1.1bil worth of assets, comprising Paradigm Mall in Petaling Jaya as well as Aeon Mall and Premiere Hotel in Klang.\nWCT\u2019s construction division is doing well, being a big beneficiary of major infrastructure projects in the country such as the light rail transit 3. The company\u2019s outstanding order book has hit RM5.5bil.\nLim has been involved in the property development and construction industries for more than 34 years.\nHis wife, Tan Kewi Yong, is the sister of Malaysian tycoon Tan Sri Robert Tan Hua Choon.\n28 DATUK LOH KIAN CHONG\nFlagship: Oriental Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.349bil\nTHE 41-year-old is the grandson of the late Tan Sri Loh Boon Siew or \u201cMr Honda\u201d, who in his lifetime was the richest man in Penang.\nKian Chong is the executive director of the Penang-based conglomerate, Oriental Holdings, and had a net worth of RM2.349bil in 2017, putting him in the 28th spot on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list.\nHe occupied the 21st spot in 2016, with a net worth of RM2.4bil.\nThe marginal decline in his net worth was led by the drop in the share price of Oriental Holdings from RM6.80 in 2016 to RM6.55 last year, which translated into a market capitalisation of RM4.06bil.\nKian Chong has 57.8% deemed interest in Oriental Holdings. This is held via the family\u2019s privately-owned companies \u2013 Boon Siew Sdn Bhd, Penang Yellow Bus Company Bhd, Bayview Hotel Sdn Bhd, Loh Boon Siew Holdings Sdn Bhd and Loh Kar Bee Holdings Sdn Bhd.\nHe is the son of Boon Siew\u2019s eldest and only surviving son, Loh Kar Bee.\nThe Oriental group, which started by selling cars, has also expanded into investment holdings and financial services, hotels and resorts, property development, automobile and related products, plastics, healthcare and others.\nKian Chong holds the reins of the Boon Siew empire and there is a shift in the business to focus more on the retail business, which has hotels and investment properties in Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Britain.\nHe joined the board of Oriental Holdings as executive director in May 2009 and was appointed as deputy chairman in November 2013. He assumed the position of chairman on Jan 1, 2015, as the third-generation took over the helm of the cash-rich company.\n29 LIM TECK MENG AND SONS, LIM PENG JIN AND LIM PENG CHEONG\nFlagship: Scientex Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.34bil\nTHANKS to the growing demand for packaging products, the net worth of Scientex\u2019s founding family saw a big jump last year.\nLim Teck Meng (pic), 80, and his sons, Lim Peng Jin, 50, and Lim Peng Cheong, 55, saw their wealth increase by about 36.1% to RM2.34bil last year.\nBut they fell two spots to 29th on Malaysia\u2019s top-40 richest list in 2017 from the 27th position in 2016.\nThe Lim family owns a 55.9% stake in Scientex, which is principally involved in industrial and consumer packaging, automotive interior, green energy products and property development businesses. The group\u2019s packaging division is now among the top-three producers of packaging materials in the world.\nScientex\u2019s market capitalisation last year rose to RM4.19bil from RM3.24bil in 2016, as the company\u2019s share price grew 31.7% to RM8.66 as at end-2017 against RM6.58 at the end of 2016.\nThe group\u2019s new stretch film manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States is expected to be commissioned by the first quarter of 2018. This plant is expected to play a pivotal and strategic role in the future, as the group explores markets in the Americas with its close proximity to its customers and source of raw materials.\nAs for its property division, Scientex has been acquiring strategic land that can be transformed into a township development.\nScientex\u2019s focus is on affordable housing.\nThe group is expected to launch its affordable housing project in the Melaka Durian Tunggal land this year.\nLast year, it completed the acquisition of 65.3 acres in Rawang. The group is looking to develop afforable homes to meet the pent-up demand in Rawang and the Klang Valley.\n30 KONG CHONG SOON @ CHI SUIM AND KONG PAK LIM\nFlagship: UOA Development Bhd and United Overseas Australia\nNet worth: RM2.124bil\nCHONG Soon and Pak Lim are self-made property billionaires who co-founded United Overseas Australia Ltd (UOA) and UOA Development Bhd.\nWith a net worth totalling RM2.34bil last year, Chong Soon and Pak Lim were the 30th richest Malaysians in 2017. In 2016, they were ranked 26th, but with a lower net worth of RM2.124bil.\nChong Soon, 76, has more than 33 years of experience in the construction and property development industries, both in Malaysia and Singapore. He is currently the managing director of UOA Development.\nPak Lim, 64, has more than 38 years of experience in the construction, mining and property development industries in both Malaysia and Australia. He is currently the executive director of UOA Development.\nChong Soon and Pak Lim co-founded UOA in 1987, and listed the company, which focuses on property development, construction, property investment, and property management, on the Australian Stock Exchange in the same year.\nOver the years, Chong Soon and Pak Lim steered the UOA group into a reputable property developer developing residential and commercial properties as well as hotels, restaurants and recreational outlets.\nIn 1989, the UOA group decided to base its headquaters and business operations in Kuala Lumpur. The group later went on to list UOA Development on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia in 2011.\nTo date, UOA Development is one of the largest listed property and construction companies in Malaysia. The UOA group is also seen strategically investing in good investment-grade commercial and residential assets in prime, high-return growth areas under UOA Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which is listed on Bursa Malaysia.\nChong Soon and Pak Lim own about an 84.6% stake in UOA through their private companies. UOA, in turn, owns 69.5% in UOA Development and a 76.6% stake in UOA REIT.\n31. DATUK TAN HENG CHEW\nFlagship: Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.306bil\nIT\u2019S been a mixed bag for the Tan family of the Tan Chong group, synonymous with the distributorship of the Nissan marque in South-East Asia and China. Heng Chew, the eldest of the seven sons of Tan Sri Tan Yuet Foh, a co-founder of the group, is the president of the group\u2019s crown jewel, Tan Chong Motor Holdings (TCM).\nHeng Chew and family hold a direct 7.6% stake in TCM and an indirect 39.3% stake through Tan Chong Consolidated Sdn Bhd (TCC), the family holding company. TCM\u2019s share price slid 19.88% last year before recovering since the beginning of the year.\nBesides his stake in TCM, Heng Chew and family also have controlling stakes in APM Automotive Holdings Bhd, a manufacturer of auto parts; Warisan TC Holdings Bhd, a tour operator as well as distributor of Shiseido and Wacoal products; and Hong Kong-listed Tan Chong International Ltd, a distributor of Nissan, Subaru and Mitsubishi vehicles.\nUnlike TCM, APM\u2019s share price finished last year with a 7.36% gain while Warisan TC and Tan Chong International both saw their share prices rising by 17.46% and 8.56%, respectively. TCM\u2019s share price performance largely reflected the flat sales of passenger vehicles last year, which contracted for the second year.\nDespite slipping in the rankings of Malaysia\u2019s richest, the family was in 23rd spot in 2016, the Tan family\u2019s net worth barely budged. Seldom in the limelight, Heng Chew and two of his brothers, Eng Soon and Eng Hwa, control the family holding company, TCC. Heng Chew\u2019s wife, Datuk Khor Swee Wah, is the group chief executive officer of TCM.\nThe youngest of Heng Chew\u2019s three sons, Anthony, is better known compared to his father, being one-half of the ride-hailing service Grab, which after the latest round of funding in the middle of last year, is now worth US$10bil, much more than the market value of all the listed companies in which TCC has stakes in.\n32. DATUK TAN CHIN NAM AND DATUK SERI ROBERT TAN CHUNG MENG & families\nFlagship: Goldis Bhd and IGB Corp Bhd\nNet worth: RM2.105bil\nTHE combined net worth of Datuk Tan Chin Nam and his nephew Datuk Seri Robert Tan (pic) together with their families rose last year compared to 2016 despite it being another challenging year for property development and the retail industry.\nGoldis controls IGB Corp, which in turn controls IGB REIT, the owner of The Gardens and Megamall in Mid Valley City. Their net worth is reflected in the share price performance of Goldis, which rose 22.16% last year, while IGB Corp jumped 27.17%.\nA year ago, Goldis, in which Chin Nam\u2019s daughter Lei Cheng is the chairman, made an offer for all the shares of IGB Corp it does not own at RM3 per share.\nIGB Corp will soon be delisted after the takeover. Goldis will then change its name to IGB Bhd (IGB), which ironically was the original name of IGB Corp that emerged through a merger and rationalisation exercise in 2000 of IGB and Tan & Tan Developments Bhd.\nThe corporate exercise in 2000 saw IGB Corp taking over the property assets of Tan & Tan, which transferred its listing status to Goldis.\nWhat will change for the Tans following the takeover of IGB Corp is that the shareholding structure will be simplified. Previously they controlled IGB Corp through Goldis\u2019 71.8% stake, and control over the prized assets in MidValley City was through IGB Corp\u2019s 52.6% stake in IGB REIT.\nThe takeover effectively removes one layer of shareholding. The Tans will also have direct control over IGB Corp\u2019s stable of hotel and office properties.\nBesides Goldis and the soon-to-be-delisted IGB Corp, the Tans also control oil and gas (O&G) services provider Wah Seong Corp Bhd, which also has a 26.9% stake in another O&G services provider, Petra Energy Bhd. A son of Chin Nam, Boon Seng, controls Hong Kong-listed Lee Hing Development Ltd through a 36.7% stake.\n33. DATUK LEONG KOK WAH\nFlagship: Eco World Development Group Bhd, Eco World International Bhd and Salcon Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.63bil\nLEONG saw his net worth rise in 2017 compared to the previous year, but slipped a notch in the rankings of the Top 40. Of his major holdings, only Eco World Development shares finished the year higher.\nEco World International, which made its Bursa Malaysia debut on March 31 last year, initially performed well but its share price fell by 14.17% by year-end. Similarly, Salcon\u2019s share price dropped 15.56% last year.\nEco World International is an Eco World Development associate that specialises in property projects outside Malaysia, while Salcon specialises in water infrastructure. Through several private vehicles, Leong, who has stockbroking and fund management background, holds substantial stakes in Eco World Development and Eco World International.\nHe sits on the boards of Eco World and Salcon. Leong is also a long-time associate of Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin, the prime mover behind Eco World Development and Eco World International.\nNotably, Eco World International has been making a name for itself when the company teamed up last December with Be Living Holdings Ltd, the development arm of British construction firm Willmott Dixon Holdings Ltd. Eco World International inked an agreement to buy a 70% stake in a development management company that will spearhead the development of 12 sites in greater London and the south-east of England with an estimated gross development value (GDV) of at least \u00a32.6bil (RM14bil).\nEco World International also announced last November that the company would redevelop a site in Sydney into 125 apartments and a small retail component with a GDV of A$139mil (RM435.35mil). The company has five current projects \u2013 three in Britain and two in Australia.\nMeanwhile, Salcon last year secured three contracts from Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd and is bidding for some RM2bil worth of water infrastructure contracts in Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. The company also sold an 80% stake in an Australian subsidiary that owned a parcel of land in Melbourne to Eco World International last April.\n 34. DATUK TEE ENG HO\nFlagship: Kerjaya Prospek Group Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.622bil\nKERJAYA Prospek has been riding high, with the company announcing a successful contract bid almost every other month last year. The construction company\u2019s share price performance reflects the news flow, soaring 86.57% last year and putting Tee, the executive chairman, into the Top-40 list for the first time.\nHe controls the company through a private vehicle, Amazing Parade Sdn Bhd, which has a 70.8% stake in Kerjaya. Its clients include major property developers who see the use of the industrialised building system, which the company has been deploying since 2010, as cost- and time-effective.\nTee also has a stake in Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O), a relationship that goes back to a time when Kerjaya was known as Fututech Bhd and was an associate of E&O. He also sits on the board of E&O.\nKerjaya was among five Malaysian firms that got into Forbes 2017 \u201cBest Under a Billion\u201d list. The company targeted RM800mil in contracts for 2017, and if the success rate was to mirror 2016\u2019s, then Kerjaya will easily achieve more than RM1bil in contract wins. In 2016, the company targeted RM600mil in contracts but more than doubled it to RM1.5bil. Last year, the company reported an outstanding order book of RM2.6bil that will keep it busy until 2020.\nBy almost all financial measurements \u2013 earnings, turnover and cashflow \u2013 the company is doing well with analysts expecting this year to surpass 2017\u2019s financial performance.\nThe most significant contract win last year was for Vertu Resort, a condominium project. The company won the RM442mil contract in August from Aspen Vision City Sdn Bhd, a joint venture between Singapore-listed Aspen (Group) Holdings Ltd and Ikea South-East Asia. Kerjaya is also undertaking a construction job from Tee\u2019s privately held property development firm for a mixed-development project with a gross development value of RM1.2bil along Jalan Klang Lama.\n35, YONG PANG CHAUN\nFlagship: Padini Holdings Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.544bil\nFROM garment manufacturer in the 1970s to a fashion retailer with a market capitalisation of RM3.47bil as at the end of 2017 is quite the achievement. For Yong, the founder and managing director, who understudied a textile merchant in Singapore in the 1960s before setting up his own business making ladies apparel, the Padini story is the story of his entrepreneurial spirit.\nHe controls Padini via a 44.5% stake held through Yong Pang Chaun Holdings Sdn Bhd. Despite the challenging consumer sentiment last year and the previous year, the company managed to post a net profit of RM157mil for the financial year ended June 30, 2017 (FY17), from FY16\u2019s RM137mil.\nPadini\u2019s share price rose to an all-time high of RM5.46 on Dec 18 and finished with a whopping 109.99% gain last year that contributed to Yong\u2019s net worth rising. Quick to react to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes over the years, he set up several different brands besides the Padini brand, including Seed, Vincci, PDI and Brands Outlet. The share price performance also reflects the market\u2019s confidence in Padini\u2019s outlook, while Budget 2018 measures boosting household incomes will mean increased private consumption with a positive spillover for consumer stocks like Padini.\nThe company has a presence not only in Malaysia but also Asean and the Middle East with 330 stores. Padini also opened 14 new stores in FY17, including six Padini Concept Stores boutiques, seven Brands Outlets and one free-standing store. It has also closed several of its Vincci and Seed outlets locally and abroad as part of plans to restructure the business and concentrate on value-for-money fashion.\nPadini was quick to see the importance of the Internet, having set up operations since 2000. The company has been busy setting up its e-commerce infrastructure and like many brick-and-mortar retailers, sees e-commerce contributing to its growth.\n36. TEONG TECK LEAN\nFlagship: GD Express Carrier Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.439bil\nRIDING on the e-commerce wave is Teong, the controlling shareholder and managing director/group chief executive officer of GD Express. This is his debut into the Top 40 rich list.\nWhile e-commerce is still in its infancy in Malaysia, investors are taking note of the potential growth of online purchases and the role of logistics in moving these goods to the buyers. Hence the interest in logistics firms such as GD Express, whose share price jumped 44.03% last year and was at its all-time high of 76 sen on May 2.\nDescribed by friends and associates as simple and down-to-earth, Teong, a small-town boy from Perak, took a gamble when he invested in loss-making GD Express Sdn Bhd back in 2000 when the company was close to going bust. At that time, he was a top dealer in OSK Securities Bhd, after stints at Texas Instruments and the old Lembaga Letrik Negara.\nTeong, who was educated in Canada as an electrical and electronics engineer, cleaned up the company and then listed it on the then Mesdaq Market, Bursa Malaysia\u2019s board for technology and high-growth stocks. Today, the operates a network of 211 stations and 654 trucks and vans.\nBut the company could have been just any other logistics company except that in early 2016 Japan\u2019s largest parcel delivery company, Yamato Holdings Co Ltd, acquired a 10% stake in GD Express for RM217mil at eye-watering valuations. That stake has since more than doubled. Yamato\u2019s entry into the company then was described as a coup for GD Express, which will be able to take advantage of Yamato\u2019s network and technology.\nThe launch of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s e-Fulfilment hub at KLIA Aeropolis Digital Free Trade Zone Park also saw renewed interest in logistics counters and how they will benefit from the hub, which aims to double growth in Malaysia\u2019s air cargo volume to 1.3 million tonnes a year within 10 years.\n37. TAN SRI ONG LEONG HUAT\nFlagship: OSK Holdings Bhd and OSK Ventures International Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.436bil\nONG would have risen up the ranks of Malaysia\u2019s rich list if the proposed merger between AMMB Holdings Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd took off last year.\nHis flagship OSK Holdings holds a 10.1% stake in RHB Bank, a result of the acquisition of the then RHB Capital Bhd of OSK Investment Bank Bhd in 2012 for RM1.95bil. Ong sits on the board of RHB Bank.\nWhen the proposed merger was being floated around, word was that Ong, a seasoned stockbroker, was looking at a cash option to exit RHB Bank. Given that the merger failed to take off, it may be sometime before he can exit the bank. Ong is not the only one involved in the bank as eldest daughter Eliza is managing director of RHB Asset Management Sdn Bhd, a unit of RHB Investment Bank Bhd.\nBesides his continued involvement in the local banking industry, Ong was appointed executive chairman of OSK Holdings last April. He was previously the company\u2019s chief executive officer and group managing director. Ong controls OSK Holdings via a 59.2% stake and OSK Ventures via a 61.6% stake.\nHis sons Ju Yan and Ju Xing were also appointed group managing director and deputy group managing director respectively. Their appointments came after the takeover of PJ Development Holdings Bhd in a second attempt that was completed in late 2016. They are responsible for the next phase of growth for the company, whose core business is property development while OSK Ventures\u2019 core business is in the venture capital/private equity space and has a 15.8% stake in Willowglen MSC Bhd.\nOSK Holdings and the Employees Provident Fund are in a joint venture to develop a 2.02-ha mixed development project called Melbourne Square in Australia. Both inked a deal last April in which OSK Holdings through PJ Development has a 51% stake in a joint venture company undertaking the project.\n38. TAN SRI LEONG HOY KUM\nFlagship: Mah Sing Group Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.242bil\nHIS name needs no introduction. A stalwart of the property industry, Leong has grown Mah Sing, which was formerly a plastics manufacturer, to a well-known property brand today.\nHe is famous for saying that the property business model is similar to manufacturing, with fast turn-around time crucial to the success of property projects.\nLast February Mah Sing unveiled its new logo and Leong\u2019s vision to take the company through the next 20 years. The new logo and vision are part of a transformation process the company has been undergoing since 2014. Part of the transformation includes a branding exercise that also involves the giving the headquarters at Wisma Mah Sing located along Jalan Sungei Besi a new look.\nTurning 60 last August as well finishing a full circle in the Chinese zodiac also gave him time to reflect on what the next two decades will bring for the company. He believes that change is necessary to stay relevant to the next generation of house buyers.\nThe company also embarked on a land acquisition plan last year, after having been quiet on that front since 2015. Mah Sing bought 11.233 acres in Cheras for RM263.48mil to be developed into a project called M Vertica and bought 10.89 acres of freehold land in Bukit Mertajam, Penang for RM43.8mil. Both these projects will have an estimated gross development value of RM2.35bil. Other acquisitions included buying a 78% stake in a company that owns 8.5 acres in Sentul in which it would build M Centura with an estimated gross development value of RM1.3bil.\nIt called off the acquisition of a freehold plot of land near Titiwangsa Lake Garden after conditions were not fulfilled while it has also stopped pursuing the long-stalled acquisition of the 85.3-acre Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Golf Course, Shah Alam. Leong has gone on record to say that the company was still on the look-out for more land, planning to spend up to RM1bil to replenish its landbank of over 2,000 acres.\n39. GOOI SEONG LIM & brothers\nFlagship: Kim Loong Resources Bhd and Crescendo Corp Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.175bil\nTHE Gooi brothers, who are involved in plantations and property through Kim Loong and Crescendo respectively, saw their net worth rise but their ranking on the Top 40 list has dropped by two notches. They first entered the list in 2017.\nHigher palm oil prices have helped with Kim Loong\u2019s earnings and profitability while the company is also venturing into biogas after commissioning three plants in Johor.\nThe plan to diversify to biogas includes supplying biogas-base power to Tenaga Nasional Bhd. It has obtained approvals from the Sustainable Electricity Development Authority to supply 3.8MW power generated from palm oil mills in Kota Tinggi, Johor and Keningau, Sabah.\nKim Loong is looking to set up another palm oil mill in Sarawak and acquiring additional plantation land in suitable locations such as in Johor, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak. It remains committed to improving efficiency and generating income from palm oil mill wastes through innovation and technology.\nKim Loong\u2019s share price has also gained 30.46% last year. It has also proposed three-for-one share split and free warrants exercise, to improve liquidity in its shares while the free warrants is to reward shareholders.\nMeanwhile, little known property developer Crescendo has seen its share price gained a much more modest 1.23% over the year. The company is the developer of the 1,390-acre Bandar Cemerlang and the 600-acre Taman Industrian Cemerlang.It is also developing another 383-acre industrial park in Bandar Nusajaya.\n40. DATUK LIM KIAN LAM\nFlagship: Ann Joo Resources Bhd\nNet worth: RM1.172bil\nLIM is a new entrant into the list. His good fortune lies in rising steel prices and lower coal prices last year.\nThis combination resulted in improving margins, good news for the steel players like Ann Joo, who have weathered some tough times in recent years with cheap Chinese steel flooding the market.\nIn fact, the company returned to profitability in 2016 after making a loss in 2015. Rising demand for steel has also helped while a curb on overcapacity in China has helped stabilise prices. Reacting to these positive catalysts, AnnJoo\u2019s share price rose 86.08% last year.\nMalaysia\u2019s decision to extend safeguard duties for steel imports to protect the local steel industry last April provided some breathing space for the steel players to start moving up the value chain and look for partners for mergers and acquisitions. Ann Joo is on the lookout for such deals.\nThe company is said to be the most cost-efficient upstream player in Malaysia and according to Kenanga Research, stands to benefit the most from the safeguard measures. Earnings of steel players last year continued to rise and the outlook remains positive given the plans for more public infrastructure projects, especially in transportation.\n      TAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMalaysia Richest , Top 40\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS24 Jan 2019\nCIMB sells stake in CHIB\nCORPORATE NEWS25 Jan 2019\nEnra integrates ICE with gas odorant ops\nBUSINESS NEWS26 Jan 2019\nStarbucks tops sales forecasts"

This, in part, is due to the fact that financial institutions such as stockbrokers are required to have major shareholders who could fulfil the \u201cfit and proper test\u201d of the Securities Commission (SC).\n ACE Group, which was sanctioned by the SC last year for breach of capital market rulings by providing false or misleading information in 2015 and 2018 , clearly had issues fulfilling the requirements to be a a major shareholder in Apex.\nHence, in a seeming move to address the thorny shareholding issue that had been hanging over the company, Apex in September 2018 entered an agreement to merge with Mercury.\nIn a nutshell, the deal would involve Apex acquiring Mercury\u2019s stockbroking, corporate advisory and other related businesses for RM140mil, and then transferring them to its unit, JF Apex Securities Bhd. And if the proposed deal materialised, Mercury would become the single largest shareholder in the merged entity with a 31% stake.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Apex\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

            "Content": "AS expected, the stock market had a relatively wild ride on Monday, its first day of business following the momentous 14th General Election (GE14).\nIt stabilised quickly after that, finishing the week marginally higher.\nHowever, the same can\u2019t be said for a handful of stocks which performed like they were on steroids.\nWhile the benchmark index gained an overall of just 0.4% from May 8, the day before GE14 until Thursday this week, these stocks shot up like there was no tomorrow, putting on double-digit gains and charting new highs.\nEduspec Holdings Bhd took the top spot, gaining a whopping 91% from May 8 to May 17, making it the stock which gained the most, percentage-wise, on Bursa Malaysia. (refer to table for list of other top-performing stocks as well as worst-performing).\nEarlier in the week, Eduspec, an IT learning services provider had shot up more than 100%.\nIt was not the only one.\nEden Inc Bhd, Thriven Global Bhd, Advance Synergy Bhd , Opcom Holdings Bhd, Dolmite Corp Bhd and Ewein Bhd all registered double-digit gains.\nWere such increases in a matter of a week, justified?\nNotably, most were smallish companies, which safe to say, had run way ahead of their fundamentals.\nAmong these, ACE Market firm Eduspec, which provides systematic IT learning and robotics programs to school children. This firm is currently loss-making.\nFor its first quarter to Dec 31, 2017, Eduspec made a net loss of RM5mil on a revenue of RM6mil.\nBut the company is said to be linked to Datuk Yeow Kheng Chew, better known as KC Yeow, who is a close associate of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s son, Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir.\nBoth KC and Mokhzani were once principal owners of oil and gas firm Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd before Yeow sold out to acquire Kencana\u2019s stake in Yinson Holdings Bhd, a company that operates floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels.\nOn Eduspec\u2019s latest top 30 shareholder list found in its annual report, a company known to be controlled by Yeow called Autonaire Sdn Bhd is listed as the single largest shareholder in Eduspec with a 9.056% stake.\nKencana Capital is listed as the eight largest shareholder with a 3.655% stake.\nFund management firm Areca Capital Sdn Bhd is also one of the substantial shareholders with a 7.545% interest.\nEduspec which derives most of its revenue from Malaysia, followed by Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong says in its annual report that the education sector remains competitive but it will continue to \u201csustain and improve the performance of the group by focusing on its strengths and improving on the quality of its offerings to schools\u201d.\nEden Inc, which is involved in the food, beverage and tourism business as well as energy and manufacturing, is a company linked to Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin, who is the son of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, the former deputy prime minister and current president of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, one of the parties that form the ruling government.\nFakhri is the son-in-law of Tan Sri Abd Rahim Mohamad and Puan Sri Fadzilah Md Ariff, who are the executive chairman and executive director of the firm, respectively.\nAbd Rahim\u2019s family controls close to 25% of Eden via a 10.92% stake in Zil Enterprise Sdn Bhd and a 14.07% interest in Serata Padu Sdn Bhd, according to its latest annual report.\nNotably, Fakhri who used to sit on the Eden board of directors resigned in December last year.\nEarnings-wise, Eden is also loss-making, chalking up a net loss of RM16.5mil in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17).\nNevertheless, compared to the same period a year earlier, its losses were narrowed.\nRevenue for FY17, meanwhile, stood at RM52mil.\nEden expects its energy sector business to help make this year a better year for the company as the two power plants it operates in Sandakan and Kelantan are expected to be fully re-commissioned after operating at limited capacities due to technical issues.\nThriven Global is also a company linked to Fakhri.\nThe company is involved in property development with projects across Peninsular Malaysia.\nIts flagship project is Lumi Tropicana, which comprises commercial and service apartments in Petaling Jaya.\nFor the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17), Thriven did see a turnaround, making a small net profit of RM201,000 versus a net loss of RM10.14mil in the previous year.\nThriven was previously known as Mulpha Land Bhd and changed its name following the entry of new major shareholders about three years ago.\nThese individuals include Ghazie Yeoh Abdullah, who is Mulpha Land\u2019s group managing director, Datuk Low Keng Siong and Fakhri.\nSince the entry of these individuals, Thriven has undergone a transformation of sorts and now has a cleaner balance sheet as compared to being debt-laden before which can to a certain extent, explain investor interest in it.\nAdvance Synergy is another politically-connected firm which has been seeing a lot of interest in the GE14 season.\nTo be sure, the firm which has diverse operations which include property development, hotels and resorts, had already started to make its way unto investor radar last year when it returned to the black with a net profit of RM4.07mil as opposed to a net loss of RM11.59mil previously.\nThe company is majority-controlled by 70-year-old Datuk Ahmad Sebi Bakar, a corporate high-flyer in the late 1980s who has often been linked to Tun Daim Zainuddin, a member of the Council of Eminent Persons and also Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Parti Keadilan Rakyat\u2019s de facto leader.\nOpcom Holdings was one the stocks which started to move up even before the GE14 fever gained traction. In the week leading to the GE, its shares had already rallied by 50% to 60.5 sen.\nAt one point during the period of May 8 to May 17, Opcom rose up to RM1.17.\nIt has since given up some of the gains to finish at 89.5 sen on Thursday, up 48%.\nThis company, involved in the manufacture of fibre optic cables and cable-related products is well-known for its connection to Mahathir\u2019s son, Mukhriz Mahathir who is one of the main shareholders of Opcom.\nHis brother, Mokhzani is the chairman and executive director at the firm.\nFor its latest quarter ended Dec 31, 2017, Opcom reported a net profit of RM586,000 on a revenue of RM27.5mil.\nMeanwhile, also dominating the gainers list this week but in terms of absolute price appreciation were the large-cap companies like British American Tobacco (BAT), Nestle (M) Bhd and Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd.\nNotably, all are consumer companies.\nIn a report to clients this week, AllianceDBS Research says consumer sentiment is expected to strengthen.\n\u201cWith the upcoming economic stimulus to be implemented by the newly elected Pakatan Harapan government, coupled with the feel good sentiment arising from the new administration, we believe that the Consumer Sentiment Index will continue to strengthen going forward which is generally positive for the consumer sector,\u201d it says.\nThe research house also upgraded BAT to a \u201cbuy\u201d this week , saying that the cigarette maker serves as the house\u2019s top pick \u201cfor exposure to the consumer recovery theme\u201d.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nWinners , Stocks\n    Related News\nBUSINESS NEWS26 Jan 2019\nGreen shoots of construction revival\nECONOMY25 Feb 2019\nMalaysia in need of growth story\nCORPORATE NEWS21 Feb 2019\nStock rally eases pressure on Asia\u2019s financial conditions"

The company, which for a long time had solely been in the manufacture and sales of acrylic products had a few years ago, under a new management, decided to diversify its earnings base.\nPETALING JAYA: ACE Market firm Asia Poly Holdings Bhd plans to venture into the food and beverage (F&B) industry.\nThe company, which for a long time had solely been in the manufacture and sales of acrylic products had a few years ago, under a new management, decided to diversify its earnings base by venturing into the power and property segments.\nAlthough both of these segments have yet to officially take off and start contributing any profit, the smallish firm \u2013 which has a market capitalisation of under RM30mil \u2013 wants to go into the F&B sector because of its seemingly resilient factor.\nSources said the firm is in serious talks to collaborate with a fairly established homegrown F&B group which currently only has outlets within the Klang Valley.\nThe plan for Asia Poly is to open more branches outside the Klang Valley via a franchise agreement with the owners of the company, which is profitable, a source familiar with the firm said.\nInterestingly, the same F&B group is also contemplating an initial public offering exercise, slated to kick-off this year if things go as planned, said the source.\nAs ambitious as its F&B plan may sound, given that Asia Poly is also planning to move into the property and power industries this year, its executive chairman Datuk Yeo Boon Leong \u2013 who bought into the company in 2015 \u2013 is thought to be a savvy businessman by some industry people.\nYeo emerged in Asia Poly by buying the entire stake of 27.61% belonging to ex-chief executive officer of hospital group Pantai Holdings, Tan Sri Lim Tong Yong, for some RM12mil.\nAt last look, Yeo had a direct stake of 21.23% in the company.\nAlthough not a familiar name in corporate circles, Yeo once helmed Bandar Kinrara Properties Sdn Bhd as managing director.\nHis family also has a business called High Reserve Marketing Sdn Bhd, which is involved in the manufacturing of locks, lock sets and other hardware.\nYeo\u2019s right-hand at Asia Poly is former Apex Equity Holdings Bhd executive director Lim Teck Seng, known to be a savvy deal-maker within industry circles.\nTeck Seng, who prior to working with the Apex group was vice-president (dealing-equity market) at MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd, joined the company when Yeo took over and currently sits on its board as non-independent non-executive director.\nWith its F&B plan, coupled with its impending foray into the property and power sectors, the source said Asia Poly, which has been impacted by high costs in recent quarters and is therefore currently loss-making, hopes to return to the black this year.\nWithin the property space, the company plans to launch a commercial project in Semenyih, which will have a gross development value of about RM40mil. This project is pending the approval of certain authorities.\nIn the power sector, Asia Poly said last December that its Indonesian unit had obtained the necessary permits for a proposed 12-megawatt hydro-electric power plant project in Aceh.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Asiapoly\n    Related News\nMARKETS04 Feb 2019\nJPMorgan: Asia stocks having a \u2018bear-market bounce\u2019\nCORPORATE NEWS02 Mar 2019\nCan Sasbadi make a comeback?\nCORPORATE NEWS02 Mar 2019\nCan Sasbadi make a comeback?"

Gao was the English interpreter to China\u2019s iconic leader Deng Xiaoping, from 1984 to 1988, when China was in the throes of opening up and reforming.\nJames Bradley, a renowned author with four best-selling books including \u2018The China Mirage\u2019 which discloses the history of American disasters in Asia, especially with regard to China.\nAnother interesting speaker is Dr Goh Chor Ching, who is economic adviser to the World Bank. She is a Malaysian with over 20 years of experience in the World Bank and is fluent in English, Chinese, French, Japanese among other languages. She has rich knowledge on the implications of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiatives.\nProfessor Peter Kagwanja is an executive of the Africa Policy Institute.

In In the next 40 years, Africa will have 1.3 billion people.\nKagwanja will explore the often overlooked relationship between China and India.\nProfessor David De Cremer from the National University of Singapore will be giving his insights on Huawei\u2019s success. Cremer is also co-author of the book \u201cHuawei: Leadership, Culture and Connectivity\u201d.\nicapital.biz is a closed-end fund listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia. It is managed by Capital Dynamics.\nCapital Dynamics is Asia\u2019s first global fund manager and investment adviser with offices in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Sydney, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\nIt is an independent fund manager and investment adviser. It currently manages assets worth some RM1bil.\nFollowing are excerpts of an interview between StarBizWeek and Tan.\nStarBizWeek: What is your market outlook and how would you position yourself and your fund? Tan: In terms of Bursa Malaysia, we are not optimistic for 2019. Its valuation is high. For example, the trailing PE ratio for the FBM KLCI is around 22 times, up from just 16.5 times a year ago. If the FBM KLCI is trading at 16.5 times trailing PE ratio, the FBM KLCI should only be trading at around 1,260 points or 25% lower than what it is now. Are there any good reasons for its current high valuation? A simple answer is none.\nMalaysian corporate earnings have been disappointing. What is more, Malaysian corporate earnings will continue to be dismal in 2019. Why? Global economic growth has slowed across the board. It is not China, the favourite scapegoat of the West. At 6.5% GDP growth, China is creating the equivalent of an entire Australian economy in one year.\nInvestors should actually look at the European Union (EU), Britain and Japan. These economies are slowing down fast. Germany narrowly missed a recession while Italy is already in one. With the not-hilarious Brexit comedy, Great Britain could soon be Little Britain. Japan has long ago become Land of the setting sun.\nEven the United States is faltering. If you stopped listening to the deafening Trump\u2019s chest thumping, we can see signs of a sharp slowdown in the United States. Retail sales, industrial production, and the weekly initial claims are all pointing to a slowing US economy and investors have ignored the US yield curve, which has flattened substantially since 2018.\nFor Malaysia, where exports will make or break her economy, we should be worried with the fall in global new export orders (see figure 1).\nThey have plunged into contraction region, implying that 2019 will be very tough for Malaysian exports.\nGlobal semiconductor sales have fallen, and crude oil price is struggling to stay where it is.\nWhat will the United States do next and are you encouraged by President Trump\u2019s measures?The United States will now focused her attention on the EU and impose tariffs. Markets have forgotten that it is not only China that has a trade surplus with the United States, the EU has a huge trade surplus with it as well.\nAs if the damage from the attack on China were not severe enough, president Trump looks set to open a new front in his trade wars with a plan to end preferential trade treatment for India. India is the world\u2019s largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences.\nI have compared president Trump with president Hoover, who was America\u2019s president in the 1930 Great Depression.\nThe other major concern is that the United States is dividing the world into camps. Based on its totally lack of understanding about China and her policies, the Trump administration is aggressively and unnecessarily pushing the whole world into a state of confrontation. America First has become to mean America Only.\nWorld trade is the only engine of global growth for every country, including the United States. A shrinking world trade simply means a shrinking global economy, which will adversely affect every economy in the world, including the increasingly isolationist US.\nIn using tariffs to literally attack every major trading nation, Trump is in effect acting like Herbert Hoover in 1930.\nThose opposing globalisation have gotten their socio-economic analysis completely wrong.\nShrinking world trade, in terms of declining exports and export orders, can and will create plenty of social and economic problems for every country, including the paranoid United States.\nExpanding world trade can only result from globalisation and an expanding global economy can only result from expanding world trade.\nAre there any other concerns? My other concern is investors\u2019 complacency. With cheap money, risk seems to be a four-letter word not to be feared.\nWhich part of the cycle are we in? A mature bull market or do you feel, the big fall is coming?\nIn terms of economics, the recovery is mature. The question is whether the current economic slowdown will become a full-fledged recession. The answer to this crucial question depends a lot on Trump and his antics.\nIn terms of the US stock market, the New York Stock Exchange ended its 2009 bull run in the last quarter of 2018 where the S&P 500 plunged more than 20%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 25% from its high in Sept 30, 2018 to its low on Dec 24, 2018.\nEven the very comprehensive Wilshire Index entered bear territory in the last quarter of 2018.\nIn terms of the Malaysian stock market, the bull ended some time ago. The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged.\nAs the Hokkiens would described it, they have plunged until you cannot recognise your own house. It is not just the BATs, the Telekoms, the many politically-linked stocks or the property and property\u2013related stocks. Astro, Hai-O, IJM Plantation, SKP Resources, Can-One, M Flour, Signature International, and many more have seen their stock prices fall.\nWhat are some of the indicators of an impending bear market?At Capital Dynamics, we look at the US monetary policy, its yield curve and perhaps most importantly, corporate earnings.\nAre your clients anticipating a drop, or are they confident?We have loyal clients. Without them, we would have closed shop a long time ago. They trust our discipline, patience, judgement, and most importantly, integrity.\nThe economy is on a better footing. Fundamentally, we are expected to see growth in most regions.\nDo you expect better earnings to also help prop up stock markets?The economy is not on a better footing, whether local or global. Malaysia\u2019s leading indicators are negative and not bottoming yet; the same for the OECD Composite leading indicator. Global trade in goods plunged towards the end of 2018. From the EU, the UK to Japan and the United States and China, 2019 will see further economic slowdown.\nLet me quote our i Capital newsletter dated Jan 17: \u201cAs the eurozone flirts or enters a new recession in 2019, what can sick Europe do? Make the negative interest rate even more negative? Restart its asset purchase programme and make a mockery of its monetary policy?\nSide with Italy\u2019s populist approach and abandon fiscal austerity? Finally wake up to the fact that the whole of Europe has simply got to work harder and stop being so lazy while earning high salaries anyway? Fix their divisive and destructive politicking?\nOr better still, get cuddlier with the United States and bash China even more?\nHas Europe forgotten that it was China\u2019s economy that bailed the whole sickly bunch of them out of the 2008 coma? Depending on how one defines the term, the eurozone and the UK still form the largest economic block in the world.\nA slide into recession at a time when the US economy is also expected to run out of steam in 2019 would make for a scary global economy. China will not be launching a 2009- type of stimulus any time soon.\nYou are obviously very negative on the United States. I am very worried about the US political leadership, Trump\u2019s administration and its economic policies. It has made a lot of mistakes in her relations with China, and it looks like it is repeating the same mistakes and unnecessarily worsening an already weak global economy.\nYou\u2019ve always been bullish on China. Can you provide a snapshot on China\u2019s growth phase and what to look forward to?The past 40 years of China\u2019s transformation have been breathtaking. To me, the next 40 years will be even more exciting and will be very rewarding for those who can take a long-term view.\nWhat is your personal conclusion on Malaysia politically and economically?People say that an enemy of your enemy is your friend. I would say that when the common enemy disappears, the old enemies will re-appear. In Malaysia\u2019s political landscape, I see \u201cold crooks, new crooks, regular crooks\u201d.\nMalaysia needs to take a truly new direction. We are still practising race-based politics and until we truly embrace and live by meritocracy, we cannot expect our fortunes to change. How can expect greatness if our own attitude is still to side with mediocrity.\nI feel that nothing has really changed. Besides, there is no clear division of responsibilities between the Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry. With such obscurity, how can the country deal with the next economic crisis?\nPeople may call me a pessimist, but I feel that Malaysia has reached the point of no return.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nStar BizWealth\n    Related News\nMARKETS28 Jan 2019\nRebound in the offing for equities this year\nOIL & GAS09 Mar 2019\nA more vibrant outlook seen for upstream O&G\nCORPORATE NEWS08 Mar 2019\nPetronas profit rises 22% to RM55.3bil in FY18, despite weaker Q4"

What is more, Malaysian corporate earnings will continue to be dismal in 2019. Why? Global economic growth has slowed across the board. It is not China, the favourite scapegoat of the West. At 6.5% GDP growth, China is creating the equivalent of an entire Australian economy in one year.\nInvestors should actually look at the European Union (EU), Britain and Japan. These economies are slowing down fast. Germany narrowly missed a recession while Italy is already in one. With the not-hilarious Brexit comedy, Great Britain could soon be Little Britain. Japan has long ago become Land of the setting sun.\nEven the United States is faltering. If you stopped listening to the deafening Trump\u2019s chest thumping, we can see signs of a sharp slowdown in the United States. Retail sales, industrial production, and the weekly initial claims are all pointing to a slowing US economy and investors have ignored the US yield curve, which has flattened substantially since 2018.\nFor Malaysia, where exports will make or break her economy, we should be worried with the fall in global new export orders (see figure 1).\nThey have plunged into contraction region, implying that 2019 will be very tough for Malaysian exports.\nGlobal semiconductor sales have fallen, and crude oil price is struggling to stay where it is.\nWhat will the United States do next and are you encouraged by President Trump\u2019s measures?The United States will now focused her attention on the EU and impose tariffs. Markets have forgotten that it is not only China that has a trade surplus with the United States, the EU has a huge trade surplus with it as well.\nAs if the damage from the attack on China were not severe enough, president Trump looks set to open a new front in his trade wars with a plan to end preferential trade treatment for India. India is the world\u2019s largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences.\nI have compared president Trump with president Hoover, who was America\u2019s president in the 1930 Great Depression.\nThe other major concern is that the United States is dividing the world into camps. Based on its totally lack of understanding about China and her policies, the Trump administration is aggressively and unnecessarily pushing the whole world into a state of confrontation. America First has become to mean America Only.\nWorld trade is the only engine of global growth for every country, including the United States. A shrinking world trade simply means a shrinking global economy, which will adversely affect every economy in the world, including the increasingly isolationist US.\nIn using tariffs to literally attack every major trading nation, Trump is in effect acting like Herbert Hoover in 1930.\nThose opposing globalisation have gotten their socio-economic analysis completely wrong.\nShrinking world trade, in terms of declining exports and export orders, can and will create plenty of social and economic problems for every country, including the paranoid United States.\nExpanding world trade can only result from globalisation and an expanding global economy can only result from expanding world trade.\nAre there any other concerns? My other concern is investors\u2019 complacency. With cheap money, risk seems to be a four-letter word not to be feared.\nWhich part of the cycle are we in? A mature bull market or do you feel, the big fall is coming?\nIn terms of economics, the recovery is mature. The question is whether the current economic slowdown will become a full-fledged recession. The answer to this crucial question depends a lot on Trump and his antics.\nIn terms of the US stock market, the New York Stock Exchange ended its 2009 bull run in the last quarter of 2018 where the S&P 500 plunged more than 20%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 25% from its high in Sept 30, 2018 to its low on Dec 24, 2018.\nEven the very comprehensive Wilshire Index entered bear territory in the last quarter of 2018.\nIn terms of the Malaysian stock market, the bull ended some time ago. The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged.\nAs the Hokkiens would described it, they have plunged until you cannot recognise your own house. It is not just the BATs, the Telekoms, the many politically-linked stocks or the property and property\u2013related stocks. Astro, Hai-O, IJM Plantation, SKP Resources, Can-One, M Flour, Signature International, and many more have seen their stock prices fall.\nWhat are some of the indicators of an impending bear market?At Capital Dynamics, we look at the US monetary policy, its yield curve and perhaps most importantly, corporate earnings.\nAre your clients anticipating a drop, or are they confident?We have loyal clients. Without them, we would have closed shop a long time ago. They trust our discipline, patience, judgement, and most importantly, integrity.\nThe economy is on a better footing. Fundamentally, we are expected to see growth in most regions.\nDo you expect better earnings to also help prop up stock markets?The economy is not on a better footing, whether local or global. Malaysia\u2019s leading indicators are negative and not bottoming yet; the same for the OECD Composite leading indicator. Global trade in goods plunged towards the end of 2018. From the EU, the UK to Japan and the United States and China, 2019 will see further economic slowdown.\nLet me quote our i Capital newsletter dated Jan 17: \u201cAs the eurozone flirts or enters a new recession in 2019, what can sick Europe do? Make the negative interest rate even more negative? Restart its asset purchase programme and make a mockery of its monetary policy?\nSide with Italy\u2019s populist approach and abandon fiscal austerity? Finally wake up to the fact that the whole of Europe has simply got to work harder and stop being so lazy while earning high salaries anyway?

Depending on how one defines the term, the eurozone and the UK still form the largest economic block in the world.\nA slide into recession at a time when the US economy is also expected to run out of steam in 2019 would make for a scary global economy. China will not be launching a 2009- type of stimulus any time soon.\nYou are obviously very negative on the United States. I am very worried about the US political leadership, Trump\u2019s administration and its economic policies. It has made a lot of mistakes in her relations with China, and it looks like it is repeating the same mistakes and unnecessarily worsening an already weak global economy.\nYou\u2019ve always been bullish on China. Can you provide a snapshot on China\u2019s growth phase and what to look forward to?The past 40 years of China\u2019s transformation have been breathtaking. To me, the next 40 years will be even more exciting and will be very rewarding for those who can take a long-term view.\nWhat is your personal conclusion on Malaysia politically and economically?People say that an enemy of your enemy is your friend. I would say that when the common enemy disappears, the old enemies will re-appear. In Malaysia\u2019s political landscape, I see \u201cold crooks, new crooks, regular crooks\u201d.\nMalaysia needs to take a truly new direction. We are still practising race-based politics and until we truly embrace and live by meritocracy, we cannot expect our fortunes to change. How can expect greatness if our own attitude is still to side with mediocrity.\nI feel that nothing has really changed. Besides, there is no clear division of responsibilities between the Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry. With such obscurity, how can the country deal with the next economic crisis?\nPeople may call me a pessimist, but I feel that Malaysia has reached the point of no return.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nStar BizWealth\n    Related News\nMARKETS28 Jan 2019\nRebound in the offing for equities this year\nOIL & GAS09 Mar 2019\nA more vibrant outlook seen for upstream O&G\nCORPORATE NEWS08 Mar 2019\nPetronas profit rises 22% to RM55.3bil in FY18, despite weaker Q4"

The losses were due to a RM7.3bil impairment made by Khazanah, which is now headed by a new managing director and board.\nRoughly half of those impairments came from MAS alone.\nSo the question is, why the impairment in MAS of more than RM3bil?\nRelated story:\nTo save or not to save MAS?\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

Every cloud has a silver lining,\u201d Azmin continued in his tweets. \u201cLook at 2018 as a clean-up of the problem assets left behind in the portfolio.\nPETALING JAYA: Khazanah Nasional Bhd surprise RM6.3bil loss for FY2018 has sparked debate over what went wrong.\nChatter between current and previous members of government have fingers pointing over responsibility for the loss.\nOn Tuesday, Khazanah announced its FY18 results, which it recorded RM6.3bil losses during the year compared with RM2.9bil profit due to impairment. Its net asset value declined more than 20% or RM25bil to RM91bil as at Dec 31, 2018 from RM116bil a year earlier.\nHalf of the impairment charge was due to the poor performance of Malaysia Airlines and a big chunk was also said to come from the write down on Khazanah\u2019s investment in Astro.\nThe social media banter started out with former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak questioning Khazanah\u2019s declining net asset value of RM25bil and made a remark that during his tenure the sovereign fund has never incurred any losses in the last 10 years.\n\u201cIn the 10 years I was Prime Minister and chairperson of the company, Khazanah never suffered losses,\u201d he said on his social media account. The statement by Najib irked the current Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, who made a barrage of sarcastic comments on Twitter yesterday. He pointed out that the losses made by Khazanah was due to review of its assets and investments made before Pakatan Harapan took over the country\u2019s administration in May last year.\n\u201cWhile it is true that Khazanah reported RM6bil losses caused by impairments that increased to more than RM7bil, this was a result of a review of the assets and investments made \u2018before\u2019 the new govt took over. What did they say about a little knowledge being dangerous?\u201d\nHe said the huge investments made by Khazanah to turn around Malaysia Airlines in the past few years had cost a whopping RM3bil impairment as the strategies implemented has not turned around the company. \u201cThe investment made over the last few years into the airline before Pakatan took over have to be impaired,\u201d he said. It was the first loss reported by Khazanah since 2005.\nDespite the losses, Khazanah announced RM1.5bil dividend, an increase from RM1bil in 2017.\nYesterday, Khazanah managing director Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, who took over the helm of Khazanah last August, said that the government had asked the fund to refresh its mandate. This includes dividing its investment objectives to commercial and strategic categories.\nHe said the refreshed mandate, amidst an ongoing restructuring, will put Khazanah on a stronger footing for enhanced profitability and performance in 2019 and onwards.\nAzmin said that 2018 was a \u201cclean up\u201d year for the problematic assets in the Khazanah portfolio. \u201cForget the blame game. Every cloud has a silver lining,\u201d Azmin continued in his tweets. \u201cLook at 2018 as a clean-up of the problem assets left behind in the portfolio. Having taken these measures, I dare say that Khazanah will return to profitability in 2019,\u201d he said. Najib added that Khazanah\u2019s net asset value of Khazanah went up from RM82.3bil at the end of 2008 to RM116bil at the end of 2017.\n\u201cRM25bil is not a small amount. It can pay nearly all of 1MDB debts or half of the cost of ECRL, which is RM55bil,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Rembau MP Khairy Jamaluddin had also made his comment on Khazanah 2018 performance, saying that the fund\u2019s core investment companies listed on Bursa Malaysia saw significant declines last year. For example, shares of Telekom Malaysia Berhad, which were at RM5 before the 14th general election, fell to RM3.24 yesterday. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd\u2019s share price dropped from RM6.90 in May 2018 to RM5.52 at yesterday\u2019s close.\n\u201cIn other words, almost all of Khazanah\u2019s key portfolio of investments did not give any positive returns,\u201d Khairy said.\nKhairy said the current economic situation was worse than before the general election in May last year coupled with the \u201cflip-flop and U-turn\u201d decisions of the Pakatan administration had led to uncertainty in investor sentiment, which affected the sovereign wealth fund.\n\u201cUntil today, the Pakatan administration has yet to have concrete plans to boost the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d he stressed.\nA fund manager said that there is a growing concern by the private sector on the current government\u2019s action plan to boost the economy.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS27 Feb 2019\nTM expects lower revenue growth this year\nPROPERTY25 Jan 2019\nTropicana\u2019s Tycoon Danny Tan makes a comeback\nAUTO22 Jan 2019\nGoldstar\u2019s legal claim puts DRB-Hicom under pressure"

Its previous close was RM3.20.\nKUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Equities Research sees a mixed market for the FBM KLCI in March, based on past performance, with average month-on-month gains over the past 10 years but negative average returns over a 40-year period.\n\nIn its strategy report issued on Tuesday, it expects the KLCI to remain volatile in 2019 due to earnings risks, policy uncertainties and external risks. \n\n\u201cOur end-2019 KLCI target is 1,638,\u201d it said, which is based on 15.1 times 12 months forward P/E. Its top three picks remain Dialog, MPI and Astro.\n\nIt has an Add for Dialog with a target price of RM4.03. Its previous close was RM3.20.\n\nDialog has a strong growth outlook as more of its tank terminal projects are commissioned, while its risk profile is low on account of its long-term leases. The company recently started reclaiming land for the Pengerang Phase 3 development project, which is expected to be commissioned in stages over CY22-23F.\n\nAs for MPI, its TP is RM15.40 versus previous close of RM9.91.  It likes MPI for its plans to double its revenue within the next three to five years, driven by new designs and customer wins in automotive and industrial semiconductor applications. On top of this, MPI is expected to benefit from the weaker ringgit against the US$.\n\nCommenting on the KLCI\u2019s performance in February, it said the 30-stock index rose 1.4% on-month in February to close at 1,708 due to improved sentiment in the global markets.\n\nIn February, the KLCI performed in line with the broader market but underperformed the small-cap sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe the gain was driven by improved sentiment in the global markets on reports that China and US are in the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of a trade deal. These more than offset the net selling from foreigners of RM800mil in February 2019.\n\n\u201cTotal market capitalisation of all the stocks listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia grew by 1.6% mom to RM1.736 trillion which is higher than the KLCI gain of 1.4% on-month,\u201d it said.\n\nKey events to watch out for in March 2019:\n\nOn the local front, investors will be watching out for new developments from the upcoming Parliament sitting which will take place from March 11  to April 11, the release of the Felda White Paper as well as Bank Negara Malaysia Annual report (slated for March 27). \n\nOn the external front, investors will continue to follow closely the latest developments on the ongoing US-China trade talks, ongoing developments of Brexit and US Federal Reserve meeting on March 19-20.\n  TAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMarkets\n    Related News\nMARKETS11 Feb 2019\nRenewed trade talks hope lifts KLCI, Utusan surges\nMARKETS07 Feb 2019\nKLCI starts new lunar year on firmer note as Tenaga lifts\nMARKETS18 Mar 2019\nBursa ekes out slight gains as Dialog, Hartalega climb"

The statement by Najib irked the current Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, who made a barrage of sarcastic comments on Twitter yesterday. He pointed out that the losses made by Khazanah was due to review of its assets and investments made before Pakatan Harapan took over the country\u2019s administration in May last year.\n\u201cWhile it is true that Khazanah reported RM6bil losses caused by impairments that increased to more than RM7bil, this was a result of a review of the assets and investments made \u2018before\u2019 the new govt took over. What did they say about a little knowledge being dangerous?\u201d\nHe said the huge investments made by Khazanah to turn around Malaysia Airlines in the past few years had cost a whopping RM3bil impairment as the strategies implemented has not turned around the company. \u201cThe investment made over the last few years into the airline before Pakatan took over have to be impaired,\u201d he said. It was the first loss reported by Khazanah since 2005.\nDespite the losses, Khazanah announced RM1.5bil dividend, an increase from RM1bil in 2017.\nYesterday, Khazanah managing director Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, who took over the helm of Khazanah last August, said that the government had asked the fund to refresh its mandate. This includes dividing its investment objectives to commercial and strategic categories.\nHe said the refreshed mandate, amidst an ongoing restructuring, will put Khazanah on a stronger footing for enhanced profitability and performance in 2019 and onwards.\nAzmin said that 2018 was a \u201cclean up\u201d year for the problematic assets in the Khazanah portfolio. \u201cForget the blame game. Every cloud has a silver lining,\u201d Azmin continued in his tweets. \u201cLook at 2018 as a clean-up of the problem assets left behind in the portfolio. Having taken these measures, I dare say that Khazanah will return to profitability in 2019,\u201d he said.

It can pay nearly all of 1MDB debts or half of the cost of ECRL, which is RM55bil,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Rembau MP Khairy Jamaluddin had also made his comment on Khazanah 2018 performance, saying that the fund\u2019s core investment companies listed on Bursa Malaysia saw significant declines last year. For example, shares of Telekom Malaysia Berhad, which were at RM5 before the 14th general election, fell to RM3.24 yesterday.

            "Content": "It has an Add for Dialog with a target price of RM4.03. Its previous close was RM3.20.\nKUALA LUMPUR: CIMB Equities Research sees a mixed market for the FBM KLCI in March, based on past performance, with average month-on-month gains over the past 10 years but negative average returns over a 40-year period.\n\nIn its strategy report issued on Tuesday, it expects the KLCI to remain volatile in 2019 due to earnings risks, policy uncertainties and external risks. \n\n\u201cOur end-2019 KLCI target is 1,638,\u201d it said, which is based on 15.1 times 12 months forward P/E. Its top three picks remain Dialog, MPI and Astro.\n\nIt has an Add for Dialog with a target price of RM4.03. Its previous close was RM3.20.\n\nDialog has a strong growth outlook as more of its tank terminal projects are commissioned, while its risk profile is low on account of its long-term leases. The company recently started reclaiming land for the Pengerang Phase 3 development project, which is expected to be commissioned in stages over CY22-23F.\n\nAs for MPI, its TP is RM15.40 versus previous close of RM9.91.  It likes MPI for its plans to double its revenue within the next three to five years, driven by new designs and customer wins in automotive and industrial semiconductor applications. On top of this, MPI is expected to benefit from the weaker ringgit against the US$.\n\nCommenting on the KLCI\u2019s performance in February, it said the 30-stock index rose 1.4% on-month in February to close at 1,708 due to improved sentiment in the global markets.\n\nIn February, the KLCI performed in line with the broader market but underperformed the small-cap sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe the gain was driven by improved sentiment in the global markets on reports that China and US are in the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of a trade deal. These more than offset the net selling from foreigners of RM800mil in February 2019.\n\n\u201cTotal market capitalisation of all the stocks listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia grew by 1.6% mom to RM1.736 trillion which is higher than the KLCI gain of 1.4% on-month,\u201d it said.\n\nKey events to watch out for in March 2019:\n\nOn the local front, investors will be watching out for new developments from the upcoming Parliament sitting which will take place from March 11  to April 11, the release of the Felda White Paper as well as Bank Negara Malaysia Annual report (slated for March 27). \n\nOn the external front, investors will continue to follow closely the latest developments on the ongoing US-China trade talks, ongoing developments of Brexit and US Federal Reserve meeting on March 19-20.\n  TAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMarkets\n    Related News\nMARKETS11 Feb 2019\nRenewed trade talks hope lifts KLCI, Utusan surges\nMARKETS07 Feb 2019\nKLCI starts new lunar year on firmer note as Tenaga lifts\nMARKETS18 Mar 2019\nBursa ekes out slight gains as Dialog, Hartalega climb"

He has been advocating his optimism on China and its growth over the next few decades .\nTan will share about what value investing is in a world of low interest rates and constant technology disruptions under the concept of \u201cNew Value Investing\u201d.\nIn 2015, Tan said: \u201cIf we were to take a sleeping pill and sleep for 50 years, Malaysia may become Argentina.\u201d\nIs he still holding on to this opinion?\nAdding zest to the event will be Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar who will examine issues around New Malaysia, the structural problems as well as its political and economic future.\nNot bullish: The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged. \u2014 AP\nOn the second day of the event, Tan will be speaking on China from a different perspective.\n\u201cThe world now feels it needs China. Perhaps it is the other way around, and China needs the world,\u201d he says.\nAmong the issues to be discussed are:\n> Should children learn Mandarin like Jim Rogers\u2019 or attend Chinese universities?\n> How will China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative impact the country and businesses?\n> Will there be World War III between the world\u2019s two superpowers?\n> Should one explore business and investment opportunities in Africa, just as China has been doing?\n> In its dealings with China, is the United States making the same mistake it made many decades ago?\nAmong the panel of speakers for day two is vice-president, Centre of China and Globalisation Victor Gao Zhikai. Gao was the English interpreter to China\u2019s iconic leader Deng Xiaoping, from 1984 to 1988, when China was in the throes of opening up and reforming.\nJames Bradley, a renowned author with four best-selling books including \u2018The China Mirage\u2019 which discloses the history of American disasters in Asia, especially with regard to China.\nAnother interesting speaker is Dr Goh Chor Ching, who is economic adviser to the World Bank. She is a Malaysian with over 20 years of experience in the World Bank and is fluent in English, Chinese, French, Japanese among other languages. She has rich knowledge on the implications of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiatives.\nProfessor Peter Kagwanja is an executive of the Africa Policy Institute. Africa is often seen as a faraway continent with little hope. In In the next 40 years, Africa will have 1.3 billion people.\nKagwanja will explore the often overlooked relationship between China and India.\nProfessor David De Cremer from the National University of Singapore will be giving his insights on Huawei\u2019s success. Cremer is also co-author of the book \u201cHuawei: Leadership, Culture and Connectivity\u201d.\nicapital.biz is a closed-end fund listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia. It is managed by Capital Dynamics.\nCapital Dynamics is Asia\u2019s first global fund manager and investment adviser with offices in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Sydney, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\nIt is an independent fund manager and investment adviser. It currently manages assets worth some RM1bil.\nFollowing are excerpts of an interview between StarBizWeek and Tan.\nStarBizWeek: What is your market outlook and how would you position yourself and your fund? Tan: In terms of Bursa Malaysia, we are not optimistic for 2019. Its valuation is high. For example, the trailing PE ratio for the FBM KLCI is around 22 times, up from just 16.5 times a year ago. If the FBM KLCI is trading at 16.5 times trailing PE ratio, the FBM KLCI should only be trading at around 1,260 points or 25% lower than what it is now. Are there any good reasons for its current high valuation? A simple answer is none.\nMalaysian corporate earnings have been disappointing. What is more, Malaysian corporate earnings will continue to be dismal in 2019. Why? Global economic growth has slowed across the board. It is not China, the favourite scapegoat of the West. At 6.5% GDP growth, China is creating the equivalent of an entire Australian economy in one year.\nInvestors should actually look at the European Union (EU), Britain and Japan. These economies are slowing down fast. Germany narrowly missed a recession while Italy is already in one. With the not-hilarious Brexit comedy, Great Britain could soon be Little Britain. Japan has long ago become Land of the setting sun.\nEven the United States is faltering. If you stopped listening to the deafening Trump\u2019s chest thumping, we can see signs of a sharp slowdown in the United States. Retail sales, industrial production, and the weekly initial claims are all pointing to a slowing US economy and investors have ignored the US yield curve, which has flattened substantially since 2018.\nFor Malaysia, where exports will make or break her economy, we should be worried with the fall in global new export orders (see figure 1).\nThey have plunged into contraction region, implying that 2019 will be very tough for Malaysian exports.\nGlobal semiconductor sales have fallen, and crude oil price is struggling to stay where it is.\nWhat will the United States do next and are you encouraged by President Trump\u2019s measures?The United States will now focused her attention on the EU and impose tariffs. Markets have forgotten that it is not only China that has a trade surplus with the United States, the EU has a huge trade surplus with it as well.\nAs if the damage from the attack on China were not severe enough, president Trump looks set to open a new front in his trade wars with a plan to end preferential trade treatment for India. India is the world\u2019s largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences.\nI have compared president Trump with president Hoover, who was America\u2019s president in the 1930 Great Depression.\nThe other major concern is that the United States is dividing the world into camps. Based on its totally lack of understanding about China and her policies, the Trump administration is aggressively and unnecessarily pushing the whole world into a state of confrontation. America First has become to mean America Only.\nWorld trade is the only engine of global growth for every country, including the United States. A shrinking world trade simply means a shrinking global economy, which will adversely affect every economy in the world, including the increasingly isolationist US.\nIn using tariffs to literally attack every major trading nation, Trump is in effect acting like Herbert Hoover in 1930.\nThose opposing globalisation have gotten their socio-economic analysis completely wrong.\nShrinking world trade, in terms of declining exports and export orders, can and will create plenty of social and economic problems for every country, including the paranoid United States.\nExpanding world trade can only result from globalisation and an expanding global economy can only result from expanding world trade.\nAre there any other concerns? My other concern is investors\u2019 complacency. With cheap money, risk seems to be a four-letter word not to be feared.\nWhich part of the cycle are we in? A mature bull market or do you feel, the big fall is coming?\nIn terms of economics, the recovery is mature. The question is whether the current economic slowdown will become a full-fledged recession. The answer to this crucial question depends a lot on Trump and his antics.\nIn terms of the US stock market, the New York Stock Exchange ended its 2009 bull run in the last quarter of 2018 where the S&P 500 plunged more than 20%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 25% from its high in Sept 30, 2018 to its low on Dec 24, 2018.\nEven the very comprehensive Wilshire Index entered bear territory in the last quarter of 2018.\nIn terms of the Malaysian stock market, the bull ended some time ago. The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged.\nAs the Hokkiens would described it, they have plunged until you cannot recognise your own house. It is not just the BATs, the Telekoms, the many politically-linked stocks or the property and property\u2013related stocks. Astro, Hai-O, IJM Plantation, SKP Resources, Can-One, M Flour, Signature International, and many more have seen their stock prices fall.\nWhat are some of the indicators of an impending bear market?At Capital Dynamics, we look at the US monetary policy, its yield curve and perhaps most importantly, corporate earnings.\nAre your clients anticipating a drop, or are they confident?We have loyal clients. Without them, we would have closed shop a long time ago. They trust our discipline, patience, judgement, and most importantly, integrity.\nThe economy is on a better footing. Fundamentally, we are expected to see growth in most regions.\nDo you expect better earnings to also help prop up stock markets?The economy is not on a better footing, whether local or global. Malaysia\u2019s leading indicators are negative and not bottoming yet; the same for the OECD Composite leading indicator. Global trade in goods plunged towards the end of 2018. From the EU, the UK to Japan and the United States and China, 2019 will see further economic slowdown.\nLet me quote our i Capital newsletter dated Jan 17: \u201cAs the eurozone flirts or enters a new recession in 2019, what can sick Europe do? Make the negative interest rate even more negative? Restart its asset purchase programme and make a mockery of its monetary policy?\nSide with Italy\u2019s populist approach and abandon fiscal austerity? Finally wake up to the fact that the whole of Europe has simply got to work harder and stop being so lazy while earning high salaries anyway? Fix their divisive and destructive politicking?\nOr better still, get cuddlier with the United States and bash China even more?\nHas Europe forgotten that it was China\u2019s economy that bailed the whole sickly bunch of them out of the 2008 coma? Depending on how one defines the term, the eurozone and the UK still form the largest economic block in the world.\nA slide into recession at a time when the US economy is also expected to run out of steam in 2019 would make for a scary global economy. China will not be launching a 2009- type of stimulus any time soon.\nYou are obviously very negative on the United States. I am very worried about the US political leadership, Trump\u2019s administration and its economic policies. It has made a lot of mistakes in her relations with China, and it looks like it is repeating the same mistakes and unnecessarily worsening an already weak global economy.\nYou\u2019ve always been bullish on China. Can you provide a snapshot on China\u2019s growth phase and what to look forward to?The past 40 years of China\u2019s transformation have been breathtaking. To me, the next 40 years will be even more exciting and will be very rewarding for those who can take a long-term view.\nWhat is your personal conclusion on Malaysia politically and economically?People say that an enemy of your enemy is your friend. I would say that when the common enemy disappears, the old enemies will re-appear. In Malaysia\u2019s political landscape, I see \u201cold crooks, new crooks, regular crooks\u201d.\nMalaysia needs to take a truly new direction. We are still practising race-based politics and until we truly embrace and live by meritocracy, we cannot expect our fortunes to change. How can expect greatness if our own attitude is still to side with mediocrity.\nI feel that nothing has really changed. Besides, there is no clear division of responsibilities between the Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry.

It likes MPI for its plans to double its revenue within the next three to five years, driven by new designs and customer wins in automotive and industrial semiconductor applications. On top of this, MPI is expected to benefit from the weaker ringgit against the US$.\n\nCommenting on the KLCI\u2019s performance in February, it said the 30-stock index rose 1.4% on-month in February to close at 1,708 due to improved sentiment in the global markets.\n\nIn February, the KLCI performed in line with the broader market but underperformed the small-cap sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe the gain was driven by improved sentiment in the global markets on reports that China and US are in the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of a trade deal.

He has been advocating his optimism on China and its growth over the next few decades .\nTan will share about what value investing is in a world of low interest rates and constant technology disruptions under the concept of \u201cNew Value Investing\u201d.\nIn 2015, Tan said: \u201cIf we were to take a sleeping pill and sleep for 50 years, Malaysia may become Argentina.\u201d\nIs he still holding on to this opinion?\nAdding zest to the event will be Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar who will examine issues around New Malaysia, the structural problems as well as its political and economic future.\nNot bullish: The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged. \u2014 AP\nOn the second day of the event, Tan will be speaking on China from a different perspective.\n\u201cThe world now feels it needs China. Perhaps it is the other way around, and China needs the world,\u201d he says.\nAmong the issues to be discussed are:\n> Should children learn Mandarin like Jim Rogers\u2019 or attend Chinese universities?\n> How will China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative impact the country and businesses?\n> Will there be World War III between the world\u2019s two superpowers?\n> Should one explore business and investment opportunities in Africa, just as China has been doing?\n> In its dealings with China, is the United States making the same mistake it made many decades ago?\nAmong the panel of speakers for day two is vice-president, Centre of China and Globalisation Victor Gao Zhikai. Gao was the English interpreter to China\u2019s iconic leader Deng Xiaoping, from 1984 to 1988, when China was in the throes of opening up and reforming.\nJames Bradley, a renowned author with four best-selling books including \u2018The China Mirage\u2019 which discloses the history of American disasters in Asia, especially with regard to China.\nAnother interesting speaker is Dr Goh Chor Ching, who is economic adviser to the World Bank. She is a Malaysian with over 20 years of experience in the World Bank and is fluent in English, Chinese, French, Japanese among other languages. She has rich knowledge on the implications of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiatives.\nProfessor Peter Kagwanja is an executive of the Africa Policy Institute. Africa is often seen as a faraway continent with little hope. In In the next 40 years, Africa will have 1.3 billion people.\nKagwanja will explore the often overlooked relationship between China and India.\nProfessor David De Cremer from the National University of Singapore will be giving his insights on Huawei\u2019s success. Cremer is also co-author of the book \u201cHuawei: Leadership, Culture and Connectivity\u201d.\nicapital.biz is a closed-end fund listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia. It is managed by Capital Dynamics.\nCapital Dynamics is Asia\u2019s first global fund manager and investment adviser with offices in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Sydney, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\nIt is an independent fund manager and investment adviser. It currently manages assets worth some RM1bil.\nFollowing are excerpts of an interview between StarBizWeek and Tan.\nStarBizWeek: What is your market outlook and how would you position yourself and your fund? Tan: In terms of Bursa Malaysia, we are not optimistic for 2019. Its valuation is high. For example, the trailing PE ratio for the FBM KLCI is around 22 times, up from just 16.5 times a year ago. If the FBM KLCI is trading at 16.5 times trailing PE ratio, the FBM KLCI should only be trading at around 1,260 points or 25% lower than what it is now. Are there any good reasons for its current high valuation? A simple answer is none.\nMalaysian corporate earnings have been disappointing. What is more, Malaysian corporate earnings will continue to be dismal in 2019. Why? Global economic growth has slowed across the board. It is not China, the favourite scapegoat of the West. At 6.5% GDP growth, China is creating the equivalent of an entire Australian economy in one year.\nInvestors should actually look at the European Union (EU), Britain and Japan. These economies are slowing down fast. Germany narrowly missed a recession while Italy is already in one. With the not-hilarious Brexit comedy, Great Britain could soon be Little Britain. Japan has long ago become Land of the setting sun.\nEven the United States is faltering. If you stopped listening to the deafening Trump\u2019s chest thumping, we can see signs of a sharp slowdown in the United States. Retail sales, industrial production, and the weekly initial claims are all pointing to a slowing US economy and investors have ignored the US yield curve, which has flattened substantially since 2018.\nFor Malaysia, where exports will make or break her economy, we should be worried with the fall in global new export orders (see figure 1).\nThey have plunged into contraction region, implying that 2019 will be very tough for Malaysian exports.\nGlobal semiconductor sales have fallen, and crude oil price is struggling to stay where it is.\nWhat will the United States do next and are you encouraged by President Trump\u2019s measures?The United States will now focused her attention on the EU and impose tariffs. Markets have forgotten that it is not only China that has a trade surplus with the United States, the EU has a huge trade surplus with it as well.\nAs if the damage from the attack on China were not severe enough, president Trump looks set to open a new front in his trade wars with a plan to end preferential trade treatment for India. India is the world\u2019s largest beneficiary of the Generalised System of Preferences.\nI have compared president Trump with president Hoover, who was America\u2019s president in the 1930 Great Depression.\nThe other major concern is that the United States is dividing the world into camps. Based on its totally lack of understanding about China and her policies, the Trump administration is aggressively and unnecessarily pushing the whole world into a state of confrontation. America First has become to mean America Only.\nWorld trade is the only engine of global growth for every country, including the United States. A shrinking world trade simply means a shrinking global economy, which will adversely affect every economy in the world, including the increasingly isolationist US.\nIn using tariffs to literally attack every major trading nation, Trump is in effect acting like Herbert Hoover in 1930.\nThose opposing globalisation have gotten their socio-economic analysis completely wrong.\nShrinking world trade, in terms of declining exports and export orders, can and will create plenty of social and economic problems for every country, including the paranoid United States.\nExpanding world trade can only result from globalisation and an expanding global economy can only result from expanding world trade.\nAre there any other concerns? My other concern is investors\u2019 complacency. With cheap money, risk seems to be a four-letter word not to be feared.\nWhich part of the cycle are we in? A mature bull market or do you feel, the big fall is coming?\nIn terms of economics, the recovery is mature. The question is whether the current economic slowdown will become a full-fledged recession. The answer to this crucial question depends a lot on Trump and his antics.\nIn terms of the US stock market, the New York Stock Exchange ended its 2009 bull run in the last quarter of 2018 where the S&P 500 plunged more than 20%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 25% from its high in Sept 30, 2018 to its low on Dec 24, 2018.\nEven the very comprehensive Wilshire Index entered bear territory in the last quarter of 2018.\nIn terms of the Malaysian stock market, the bull ended some time ago. The FBM KLCI is trading at levels that only those who believe in musical chairs will understand. When one looks beyond the FBM KLCI, a lot of stocks have plunged.\nAs the Hokkiens would described it, they have plunged until you cannot recognise your own house. It is not just the BATs, the Telekoms, the many politically-linked stocks or the property and property\u2013related stocks. Astro, Hai-O, IJM Plantation, SKP Resources, Can-One, M Flour, Signature International, and many more have seen their stock prices fall.\nWhat are some of the indicators of an impending bear market?At Capital Dynamics, we look at the US monetary policy, its yield curve and perhaps most importantly, corporate earnings.\nAre your clients anticipating a drop, or are they confident?We have loyal clients. Without them, we would have closed shop a long time ago. They trust our discipline, patience, judgement, and most importantly, integrity.\nThe economy is on a better footing. Fundamentally, we are expected to see growth in most regions.\nDo you expect better earnings to also help prop up stock markets?The economy is not on a better footing, whether local or global. Malaysia\u2019s leading indicators are negative and not bottoming yet; the same for the OECD Composite leading indicator. Global trade in goods plunged towards the end of 2018. From the EU, the UK to Japan and the United States and China, 2019 will see further economic slowdown.\nLet me quote our i Capital newsletter dated Jan 17: \u201cAs the eurozone flirts or enters a new recession in 2019, what can sick Europe do? Make the negative interest rate even more negative? Restart its asset purchase programme and make a mockery of its monetary policy?\nSide with Italy\u2019s populist approach and abandon fiscal austerity? Finally wake up to the fact that the whole of Europe has simply got to work harder and stop being so lazy while earning high salaries anyway? Fix their divisive and destructive politicking?\nOr better still, get cuddlier with the United States and bash China even more?\nHas Europe forgotten that it was China\u2019s economy that bailed the whole sickly bunch of them out of the 2008 coma? Depending on how one defines the term, the eurozone and the UK still form the largest economic block in the world.\nA slide into recession at a time when the US economy is also expected to run out of steam in 2019 would make for a scary global economy. China will not be launching a 2009- type of stimulus any time soon.\nYou are obviously very negative on the United States. I am very worried about the US political leadership, Trump\u2019s administration and its economic policies. It has made a lot of mistakes in her relations with China, and it looks like it is repeating the same mistakes and unnecessarily worsening an already weak global economy.\nYou\u2019ve always been bullish on China. Can you provide a snapshot on China\u2019s growth phase and what to look forward to?The past 40 years of China\u2019s transformation have been breathtaking. To me, the next 40 years will be even more exciting and will be very rewarding for those who can take a long-term view.\nWhat is your personal conclusion on Malaysia politically and economically?People say that an enemy of your enemy is your friend. I would say that when the common enemy disappears, the old enemies will re-appear. In Malaysia\u2019s political landscape, I see \u201cold crooks, new crooks, regular crooks\u201d.\nMalaysia needs to take a truly new direction. We are still practising race-based politics and until we truly embrace and live by meritocracy, we cannot expect our fortunes to change. How can expect greatness if our own attitude is still to side with mediocrity.\nI feel that nothing has really changed. Besides, there is no clear division of responsibilities between the Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Ministry. With such obscurity, how can the country deal with the next economic crisis?\nPeople may call me a pessimist, but I feel that Malaysia has reached the point of no return.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nStar BizWealth\n    Related News\nMARKETS28 Jan 2019\nRebound in the offing for equities this year\nOIL & GAS09 Mar 2019\nA more vibrant outlook seen for upstream O&G\nCORPORATE NEWS08 Mar 2019\nPetronas profit rises 22% to RM55.3bil in FY18, despite weaker Q4"

These more than offset the net selling from foreigners of RM800mil in February 2019.\n\n\u201cTotal market capitalisation of all the stocks listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia grew by 1.6% mom to RM1.736 trillion which is higher than the KLCI gain of 1.4% on-month,\u201d it said.\n\nKey events to watch out for in March 2019:\n\nOn the local front, investors will be watching out for new developments from the upcoming Parliament sitting which will take place from March 11  to April 11, the release of the Felda White Paper as well as Bank Negara Malaysia Annual report (slated for March 27). \n\nOn the external front, investors will continue to follow closely the latest developments on the ongoing US-China trade talks, ongoing developments of Brexit and US Federal Reserve meeting on March 19-20.\n  TAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMarkets\n    Related News\nMARKETS11 Feb 2019\nRenewed trade talks hope lifts KLCI, Utusan surges\nMARKETS07 Feb 2019\nKLCI starts new lunar year on firmer note as Tenaga lifts\nMARKETS18 Mar 2019\nBursa ekes out slight gains as Dialog, Hartalega climb"

Oil bulls were also encouraged by doubts on whether the Federal Reserve will decide to hike US interest rates on Thursday after tame August inflation data. - Reuters\n\nTop foreign news\n\nBrewer AB InBev seeks US$27bil tie-up with SABMiller: Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, has approached rival SABMiller about a takeover that would form a colossus producing a third of the world's beer. A merged group would have a market value of around US$275 billion at current prices, and would combine AB InBev's dominance of Latin America with SABMiller's of Africa, both fast-growing markets, as well as their breweries in Asia. - Reuters\n\nWeak US inflation complicates Fed rate decision: US consumer prices unexpectedly fell in August as gasoline prices resumed their decline and a strong dollar curbed the cost of other goods, pointing to tame inflation that complicates the Federal Reserve's decision whether to hike interest rates. The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.1%, the first drop since January, after edging up 0.1% in July. - Reuters\n\nGE sells US$3.7bil UK home loan portfolio to Kensington Mortgage: General Electric Co said on Wednesday it had sold a US$3.7 billion portfolio of loans from its British home lending business to private equity-backed Kensington Mortgage Co Ltd as it continues to shrink its financing arm, GE Capital. The deal nearly halves the size of the company's UK home lending business to less than US$7 billion. - Reuters\n\nA decade after write-offs, Africa sliding back into debt trap: With their economies floundering and currencies sinking, African states that have borrowed heavily in dollars may be slipping back into the debt trap - and ultimately default - only a decade after a far-reaching round of debt forgiveness. Some are looking to issue more Eurobonds to refinance existing foreign currency loans, but with US interest rates set to rise soon, the inevitably higher borrowing costs will do little to alleviate pressure on creaking state budgets. - Reuters\n\nTop local stories\n\nMalaysian trimming workforce: There is a sense of urgency among banks to become more cost-efficient amid the current challenging landscape, with the focus on reducing their workforce to an optimal level. RAM Ratings co-head of financial institution ratings Wong Yin Ching said tha banks'  move comes amid the softer earnings outlook as well as slower loans growth and continued margin compression. - StarBiz\n\nIndia's Yepme raises US$75mil from investors led by Khazanah: Indian online fashion retailer Yepme has raised US$75 million from investors led by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, two sources told Reuters.

The plant is expected to begin operations in 2017 and will produce a new generation of test and robotic equipment for the semiconductor industry. - StarBiz\n\nEarnings of O&G players likely to remain subdued: The earnings of oil and gas (O&G) players will continue to soften as Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is expected to tighten its capital and operational expenditures following weak crude oil prices. RHB Research expects the upstream-related expenditure to slow down for both Petronas and other majors as well, transferring down the value chain. - StarBiz\n\nDevelopers neutral to pessimistic on prospects: Developers are generally neutral to pessimistic on the prospects of the local property market, given the increasing costs and the rising number of unsold properties.

Four listed timber firms, Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd, Subur Tiasa Holdings Bhd, Ta Ann Holdings Bhd and WTK Holdings Bhd, saw their log output fall between 12% and 25%. But for most of those companies, their earnings have not been negatively impacted, thanks to the steep increase in log prices. - StarBiz\n\nBouygues UK bags RM6.5bil Battersea job: Battersea Power Station Development Co (BPSDC), the development manager of the Battersea Power Station project in London, has appointed Bouygues UK as the preferred contractor for Phase 3 of the project, with a contract worth over \u00a31 billion (RM6.51 billion). - digitaledge\n\nPessimism persists despite higher auto sales: Malaysian Auto- motive Association\u2019s (MAA) latest sales data show Malaysians bought more cars in August compared with the same month last year.

In the rush of our modern world, coupled with social media being mistaken for genuine news, a market is often shrunk down to labels, symbols and colours even - like \"red\" or \"green\", \"growing\" or \"shrinking\" and even \"big\" or \"small\". \n\nThese simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They're also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\n\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. \n\nBut behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n\nMalaysia's capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. \n\nThey've grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\n\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It's not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\n\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\n\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. \n\nThey also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. \n\nBuilding sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation's development.\n\nThe lifeblood of a nation's economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. \n\nFlush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\n\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation's GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. \n\nFor SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. \n\nThere are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\n\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. \n\nEvery day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n\nInnovation isn't always about the newest. Sometimes, it's about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\n\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world's first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world's first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\n\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\n\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\n\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now.

In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth.\"\nA CAPITAL market is commonly described as \"up\" or \"down\". In the rush of our modern world, coupled with social media being mistaken for genuine news, a market is often shrunk down to labels, symbols and colours even - like \"red\" or \"green\", \"growing\" or \"shrinking\" and even \"big\" or \"small\". \n\nThese simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They're also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\n\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. \n\nBut behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n\nMalaysia's capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. \n\nThey've grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\n\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It's not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\n\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\n\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. \n\nThey also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. \n\nBuilding sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation's development.\n\nThe lifeblood of a nation's economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. \n\nFlush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\n\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation's GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. \n\nFor SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. \n\nThere are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\n\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. \n\nEvery day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n\nInnovation isn't always about the newest. Sometimes, it's about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\n\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world's first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world's first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\n\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\n\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\n\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now.

In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. But behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n> Connecting businesses to a global base\nMalaysia\u2019s capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. They\u2019ve grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It\u2019s not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. They also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. Building sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation\u2019s development.\n> Connecting to the future\nThe lifeblood of a nation\u2019s economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. Flush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. For SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n> Connecting Malaysians to the idea of investing\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. There are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. Every day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n> Connecting innovation to progress\nInnovation isn\u2019t always about the newest. Sometimes, it\u2019s about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. Literally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still \u2018young\u2019, as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n> Making it possible through ambition, purpose and clarity\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit. But it is a purpose that we at Bursa Malaysia take to heart, as we put our minds and souls into developing the connections that bring it all together.\n\u201cModern problems surely require new solutions.

In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. But behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n> Connecting businesses to a global base\nMalaysia\u2019s capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. They\u2019ve grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It\u2019s not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. They also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. Building sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation\u2019s development.\n> Connecting to the future\nThe lifeblood of a nation\u2019s economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. Flush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. For SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n> Connecting Malaysians to the idea of investing\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. There are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. Every day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n> Connecting innovation to progress\nInnovation isn\u2019t always about the newest. Sometimes, it\u2019s about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. Literally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still \u2018young\u2019, as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n> Making it possible through ambition, purpose and clarity\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit.

These simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They\u2019re also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. But behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n> Connecting businesses to a global base\nMalaysia\u2019s capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. They\u2019ve grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It\u2019s not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. They also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. Building sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation\u2019s development.\n> Connecting to the future\nThe lifeblood of a nation\u2019s economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. Flush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. For SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n> Connecting Malaysians to the idea of investing\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. There are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. Every day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n> Connecting innovation to progress\nInnovation isn\u2019t always about the newest. Sometimes, it\u2019s about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform).

They\u2019re also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. But behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n> Connecting businesses to a global base\nMalaysia\u2019s capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. They\u2019ve grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It\u2019s not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. They also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. Building sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation\u2019s development.\n> Connecting to the future\nThe lifeblood of a nation\u2019s economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. Flush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. For SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n> Connecting Malaysians to the idea of investing\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. There are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. Every day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n> Connecting innovation to progress\nInnovation isn\u2019t always about the newest. Sometimes, it\u2019s about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. Literally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still \u2018young\u2019, as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n> Making it possible through ambition, purpose and clarity\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit. But it is a purpose that we at Bursa Malaysia take to heart, as we put our minds and souls into developing the connections that bring it all together.\n\u201cModern problems surely require new solutions.

Literally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still \u2018young\u2019, as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n> Making it possible through ambition, purpose and clarity\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit. But it is a purpose that we at Bursa Malaysia take to heart, as we put our minds and souls into developing the connections that bring it all together.\n\u201cModern problems surely require new solutions. Let\u2019s see things afresh, and work together from there.\u201d Datuk Umar Swift, CEO of Bursa Malaysia.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMarkets , Bursa Malaysia , Connections\n    Related News\nMARKETS18 Feb 2019\nForeign investors turn net sellers again\nMARKETS25 Feb 2019\nBursa Malaysia sees second straight week of net foreign selling\nMARKETS06 Mar 2019\nKLCI ends moderately higher"

BAT had its worst year on record last year, slumping 50%, as the US Food and Drug Administration toughened its stance toward the tobacco industry. Philip Morris slumped 37%.\nThe MSCI World Tobacco Index returned an impressive 1,437% from the end of 1999 through 2015, compared with just a 72% return for the broader MSCI World Index. But since 2016, when momentum for tobacco-free portfolios finally started to take hold, the industry has underperformed the broader benchmark.\n\u201cClearly, selling pressure from some investor classes who have decided that it is inappropriate to invest in tobacco for environmental, social and governance reasons will have been unhelpful for tobacco share prices, given the scale of some of the institutions concerned,\u201d Investec analyst Eddy Hargreaves said in written comments.\nBronwyn King, an Australian doctor who treats cancer patients, was shocked to discover in 2010 that her retirement fund was investing in tobacco companies. This prompted her to establish Tobacco Free Portfolios, a non-profit organization that encourages pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks and insurers to stop investing in tobacco.\nThe initiative went global: French insurer Axa SA in May 2016 announced it would stop investing in the tobacco sector due to the prevalence of smoking-related diseases. U.K. insurer Aviva Plc started selling its tobacco shares in June 2017 and no longer holds any of the stocks in its actively managed funds, it said.\nThe momentum has spread further throughout Europe since then. Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the pension fund for Dutch government and education workers, in January 2018 pledged to sell all of its investments in the tobacco and nuclear-weapons industries within a year, while Swedish pension fund Forsta AP-fonden said that tobacco was among the industries its AP1 fund no longer invests in as of the beginning of this year.\nThe exit by pension funds and insurers added to the tobacco industry\u2019s woes at a time when it also faced increased regulatory scrutiny from health authorities trying to limit the spread of the cancer-causing product, as well as the uncertain volume trajectories of both conventional cigarettes and so-called next-generation devices.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate a sea-change back into more positive investor sentiment for tobacco in the nearer term,\u201d said Hargreaves, who said tighter regulation was having a bigger impact on the stocks than the divestitures.\nTobacco shares surged after the surprise resignation announcement on March 5 from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who had indicated the agency would seek to require companies to reduce nicotine levels and restrict sales of e-cigarettes to minors and of menthol cigarettes.\u2014 Bloomberg\n    Related News\nNATION01 Feb 2019\nBan cigarette sales near schools, say experts\nCORPORATE NEWS30 Jan 2019\nAIA GOING STRONG ON ITS BRAND PROMISE\nNATION25 Jan 2019\nSurvey: 70% retailers accepted incentives by tobacco companies to display cigarette packs prominently"

The Philippine market is expected to see both models soon after.\n\u201cWith 92,000 Mazda vehicles on Malaysian roads since 2009, BAuto is starting to reap the benefit of higher margins from its recurring after-sales service and parts revenue.\n\u201cContributing 8% to 2018 revenue, we expect this stream of recurring revenue to grow to 9% in 2019,\u201d it said.\nThe research house said it is revising its earnings forecasts for BAuto upwards.\n\u201cMost of our revisions in sales volume are at the Malaysian operations whereby nine-month 2019 unit sales of 12,600 already made up 85% of our full-year estimate.\n\u201cWe have raised our 2019 to 2021 Mazda sales forecast in Malaysia by 6%, 10% and 4%, respectively, to account for the change in sales mix and new launches in 2020.\n\u201cAlongside better margins from higher recurring after-sales service and parts, as well as lower sales and service tax expenses, our 2019 to 2021 earnings forecasts are raised by 11%, 8% and 5%, respectively.\u201d\nMaybank IB also said it made no changes to its yen-to-ringgit foreign exchange (forex) assumption of 3.70 (compared with the current rate of 3.67). \u201cOur projected three-year earnings compounded annual growth rate now stands at 30%.\u201d\nSeparately, the research house said BAuto\u2019s third quarter 2019 core earnings of RM84mil broke its highest quarterly record in the second quarter of the same year.\n\u201cAt 87% of our full-year, nine-month 2019 results trumped our street-high expectation, prompting a lift in our 2019 to 2021 earnings forecasts, incorporating higher sales volume and margins.\n\u201cRolling forward our valuations to 2020 but at a lower price-to-earnings ratio peg of 13 times, our new target price is RM3.38. Backed by attractive yields of 8.7% in 2020, BAuto is a high-conviction buy.\u201d\nBAuto\u2019s previous high in yearly earnings was recorded in 2015 whereby core net profit jumped 57% year-on-year to RM222mil.\nMaybank IB, however, emphasised that there were several risk factors for its earnings estimates, price target and rating for BAuto.\n\u201cA sharp turn in consumer sentiment in the Malaysian market where BAuto\u2019s key operation is may affect its sales volume. \u201cAdditionally, forex volatility, especially yen to ringgit, will affect BAuto\u2019s earnings, for almost 35% of the group\u2019s cost of goods sold is denominated in yen.\u201d\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nAuto , Automotive , Corporate News\n    Related News\nAUTO08 Feb 2019\nNew launches to drive BAuto\u2019s Q3 earnings\nAUTO22 Jan 2019\nGoldstar\u2019s legal claim puts DRB-Hicom under pressure\nAUTO25 Jan 2019\nFord feels Wall Street\u2019s pain over slow turnaround"

In some cases, for the short-term, but in most cases, for the longer-term.\nThe depressed prices are giving investors opportunities to start scouting around and maybe start nibbling at certain counters that are seeing some real value emerging.\nIn this regard, StarBizWeek has chosen 10 counters for investors to look at.\nThe stocks are picks by fund managers and journalists that track corporate companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.\nFUND MANAGERS\u2019 PICKS\nFRANCIS ENG\nChief investment officer\nUOB Asset Management (M) Bhd\nPENTAMASTER CORP BHD\nMarket capitalisation: RM747.1mil\nFifty-two-week high: RM3.79\nFifty-two-week low: RM1.70\nPENTAMASTER is an automated testing, automation manufacturing and technology solutions provider. The company\u2019s main customers are in the telecommunications, automotive, semiconductor, consumer electronics and medical devices industry. Pentamaster employs over 350 engineers and is based in Penang.\nWe believe that Pentamaster can sustain its earnings momentum going forward, underpinned by a few key factors. Firstly, we expect demand for Pentamaster\u2019s testing solutions to be driven by increasing volume of smart sensors and 3D sensing technology in smartphones.\nSecondly, Pentamaster\u2019s continuous diversification efforts and expansion into new segments, particularly the automotive and medical industries, are starting to yield results. Demand from the automotive and medical sectors tends to be relatively more stable compared with semiconductors, which can be cyclical. There are growth prospects for Pentamaster in the automotive sector, especially in electric vehicles.\nEng: Pentamaster can sustain its earnings momentum.\nThirdly, Pentamaster has developed in-house automation systems which have capabilities in automating manufacturing processes. We believe that there is strong growth potential for such systems as more manufacturing companies embrace Industry 4.0.\nPentamaster is poised to capture opportunities as its capacity has almost tripled with the completion of a new plant in Batu Kawan in mid-2018.\nAdditionally, Pentamaster could be a beneficiary of the US-China trade war if multinational manufacturers who shift their production from China to Malaysia were to source their test equipment from local suppliers.\nValuation-wise, Pentamaster is trading at a price earnings ratio (PER) of 10 times in financial year 2019, which is at a discount to its equipment maker peers which are trading at more than 20 times the PER.

Coupled with a net cash position of RM11.7mil, the company is primed to capitalise on opportunities that come its way.\nIt also had an order book of RM42.3mil as at Oct 31, 2018. At its current price of 18 sen, the stock is trading below its IPO price, and only has a market capitalisation of RM71.61mil.\nBCM is in the business of selling medical equipment and devices, and providing commercial laundry services.

Is it due to a structural issue or the pricing by promoters being deemed to be \u2018very high\u2019 by institutional placees and high net-worth investors? \u2014 AP\nNo big flotations last year, how will the upcoming big IPOs fare?\nINITIAL public offerings (IPOs) on the local bourse are increasingly losing their shine.\nAnd this year, the few big upcoming IPOs are re-listings, meaning these are companies that had been listed before, were later taken private and now are being re-listed.\nThis shows a dearth of new large companies in Malaysia.\nFlashback: DPI making its debut on the Ace Market earlier this month.  \nCompounding matters is the fact that the two big IPOs coming to market this year are poultry-linked companies which are trying to hit the market at very high values.\nQSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, which operates the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Hut chains, is reportedly looking to list at a historical price-earnings ratio (PER) of around 40 times and a forward PER of 30.\nThen, there is Leong Hup International Bhd that is involved in livestock feed manufacturing, egg production and poultry farming. It is said to be looking at a forward PER of around 30 times earnings.\nMr DIY, backed by private equity firm Creador, is exploring an IPO valuing the company at around RM10bil. This could mean listing at a toppish PER of at least 30 times historical earnings.\nThis likely means that the promoters of these stocks will find it tough to get investors to subscribe to them.\nBut first, why the dearth of new large companies coming to the market?\nOne economist explains the lack of mega-IPOs here as a structural issue the country is facing.\nHe points out that the number of high-tech companies in Malaysia has declined since 2000 and this, in turn, is the result of a lack of investments within this space.\n\u201cThere is a structural problem in Malaysia.\n\u201cPolicies need to be addressed to create a fertile ground for the creation of large high-tech companies,\u201d he says.\nFormer senior investment banker Ian Yoong Kah Yin says it\u2019s simply a case of the pricing of the IPOs by promoters being deemed to be \u201cvery high\u201d by institutional placees and high-net-worth investors.\n\u201cThe investment story has, therefore, to be compelling, mainly (have) high earnings growth potential or be at low earning multiples,\u201d he tells StarBizweek.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMega\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

It has a track record of more than 30 years. Bioalpha has not finalised the purchase price.\nCGS CIMB believed there is synergy in acquiring a stake in the North West Enterprise as it offered a distribution channel to hotels all across the country.\nIt said the company could distribute its local tea products such as tongkat ali tea, kacip fatimah tea and bumi hempedu tea to tourists staying in the hotels.\nIt said there are no details yet on the profitability of North West Enterprise but, in the worse case of zero profit from North West Enterprise, the potential dilution to financial year 2019 to 2020 (FY19-FY20) earnings per share (EPS) is around 6%.\nThe target price CGS CIMB has set would fall from 44 sen 50 41 sen, assuming no EPS enhancement from the acquisition, which is unlikely due to the potential anticipated synergies from buying the company.\nThe stock remains an \u201cadd\u201d.\n\u201cUntil more financial details on North West Enterprise are available, we maintain our EPS forecasts and target price, based on an unchanged 20 times forecast 2019 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a 20% discount to our consumer target P/E for forecast 2019 of 25 times,\u201d the brokerage said.\nMATRIX CONCEPTS HOLDINGS BHD\nBy RHB Research Institute\nBuy (maintained)\nTarget price: RM2.40\nMATRIX Concepts has announced a joint-venture (JV) agreement with Bangun Kosambi Sukses (BKS) and Nikko Sekuritas Indonesia (NSI) to jointly develop an Islamic financial district on an 8.9-acre land in West Kosambi Village, Kosambi District, Tangerang Regency.\nRHB Research is positive on this JV backed by Indonesia\u2019s biggest conglomerate, the Salim Group.\nBKS is owned by the Salim Group, which is involved in the property development for PIK 2 Sedayu Indo City \u2013 spanning 1,000 hectares \u2013 in Indonesia. NSI is an investment banking firm. The signing of the JV agreement marked the maiden step for Matrix to enter the Indonesian property market.\nRHB Research said it liked Matrix\u2019s efforts in venturing overseas, as the Malaysian property market is undergoing a soft period.\n\u201cIn the long run, the domestic market may also become more saturated with players. Indonesia \u2013 South-East Asia\u2019s most populous country \u2013 has market growth potential,\u201d it added.\nThe JV will require the company to inject a share capital of RM125mil for a 30% stake \u2013 to be paid in two tranches.\nThe first tranche (RM65mil) will be paid in six months and the second tranche (RM60mil) will be paid after that.\nRHB Research believed Matrix would likely finance this with a combination of internal funds, debt and potential new equity, given Matrix\u2019s current net gearing of 6% as well as its small-scale project in Australia.\nThe research house also believed that the potential interest expenses and dilution from the new equity should be manageable for the company, especially in the initial few years.\n\u201cHaving said that, Matrix may become more conservative on its dividend payout ratio, which will likely be kept below 40% (its policy) going forward,\u201d it said.\nRHB Research has maintained its \u201cbuy\u201d call as the details on financing as well as the project\u2019s gross development value, phases and development components have yet to be revealed. It is, therefore, keeping its earnings forecasts and revised net asset value (RNAV) estimates unchanged.\nKELINGTON GROUP BHD\nBy Affin Hwang\nBuy\nTarget price: RM1.60\nKELINGTON\u2019S next wave of growth will likely see the group leveraging on its past experience, moving upstream and expanding into the supply and trading of industrial gases.\nKelington\u2019s venture into the business of supplying industrial gases is part of the management\u2019s long-term group growth initiative.\nOnce the first plant is up and running by September 2019, the group will effectively be the second-largest liquid carbon dioxide player in town.\nAffin Hwang believed that prospects are bright as the usage of industrial gases continued to expand rapidly into various industries.\nKelington\u2019s forecast 2019 and 2020 core net profit are set to post three-year compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of 13% and 22%, respectively, driven by prospective growth in China and Singapore ultra-high purity contract flows.\nThe research house expected a progressive ramp-up at Kelington\u2019s liquid carbon dioxide plant and future expansion projects to be key earnings re-rating catalysts in the coming years, which would also help to lift the overall group margin.\nAffin Hwang has initiated a coverage on Kelington with a \u201cbuy\u201d call and 12-month target price of RM1.60, based on a forecast financial year 2019 P/E ratio of 16 times.\nThe research house said it liked the company for a few reasons \u2013 being that the semiconductor industry is still poised for growth, a huge China presence and benefits from \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d masterplan.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nAnalyst Reports , Stocks Analysis , Corporate News , Analyst Reports\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS18 Feb 2019\nGrowth momentum to continue for Carlsberg\nCONSTRUCTION29 Jan 2019\nQuick take: MRCB upgraded after RM323m job\nCORPORATE NEWS28 Feb 2019\nCIMB Research retains Reduce for AirAsia, TP RM1.82"

So, some may not understand (BCorp\u2019s business model),\u201d Tan says.\nWhile there is a tendency of markets to value a diversified group of businesses and assets at less than the sum of its part, the so-called \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d applied to BCorp has been unjustifiably excessive, in Tan\u2019s view.\nHowever, one analyst challenges that notion by pointing out that BCorp\u2019s financial performance has neither been impressive nor consistent in recent years.\n\u201cThere are reasons why the counter lacks appeal. It is not a yield play to begin with, and its financial performance has not been very impressive or consistent in recent years,\u201d the analyst with a foreign brokerage explains.\nBe that as it may, Tan, who returned to the helm of the Berjaya group in November last year after a five-year hiatus, is undertaking a strategic review of his businesses in the hope of improving their performance.\n  Business restructuring\nAccording to sources, Tan has been meeting up with bankers as far back as a year ago, seeking to sell BCorp\u2019s assets as part of a plan to restructure his business empire.\n\u201cBCorp is asset-heavy, but light on cash flow. In a liquidity crunch, the group will definitely be hit. So, better sell now for the potential storm ahead,\u201d the source tells StarBizWeek.\n\u201cAnd Tan wants to sell \u2018everything\u2019 \u2013 but at a very high premium. Hence, there have been some challenges faced in his attempt to dispose of some of his prized assets,\u201d he adds.\nNevertheless, the source points out that Tan\u2019s track record shows that the tycoon has the ability to hang on to his assets until he gets the \u201cright price\u201d, citing the case of Digi.Com Bhd .\nIn 1999, Tan sold his stake in Digi, which was then known as Digi.Swisscom Bhd, and walked away from the investment with a bounty estimated at more than RM1.5bil.\nAs at end-July, BCorp\u2019s total assets stood at RM20.5bil, with cash and cash equivalents totalling RM1.3bil.

            "Content": "Tan: We\u2019re in the business for profits, not for glory.\nHE has said it once, he has said it many times \u2013 the market doesn\u2019t know how to value his companies.\nBerjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) founder and executive chairman Tan Sri Vincent Tan can only speculate on the reason why most fund managers find it difficult to understand the business of his diversified conglomerate.\nFor BCorp specifically, the 66-year-old tycoon quips that the business model resembles \u201crojak\u201d, implying that it is too diversified.\n\u201cIt is a conglomerate, so it owns many things. So, some may not understand (BCorp\u2019s business model),\u201d Tan says.\nWhile there is a tendency of markets to value a diversified group of businesses and assets at less than the sum of its part, the so-called \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d applied to BCorp has been unjustifiably excessive, in Tan\u2019s view.\nHowever, one analyst challenges that notion by pointing out that BCorp\u2019s financial performance has neither been impressive nor consistent in recent years.\n\u201cThere are reasons why the counter lacks appeal. It is not a yield play to begin with, and its financial performance has not been very impressive or consistent in recent years,\u201d the analyst with a foreign brokerage explains.\nBe that as it may, Tan, who returned to the helm of the Berjaya group in November last year after a five-year hiatus, is undertaking a strategic review of his businesses in the hope of improving their performance.\n  Business restructuring\nAccording to sources, Tan has been meeting up with bankers as far back as a year ago, seeking to sell BCorp\u2019s assets as part of a plan to restructure his business empire.\n\u201cBCorp is asset-heavy, but light on cash flow. In a liquidity crunch, the group will definitely be hit. So, better sell now for the potential storm ahead,\u201d the source tells StarBizWeek.\n\u201cAnd Tan wants to sell \u2018everything\u2019 \u2013 but at a very high premium. Hence, there have been some challenges faced in his attempt to dispose of some of his prized assets,\u201d he adds.\nNevertheless, the source points out that Tan\u2019s track record shows that the tycoon has the ability to hang on to his assets until he gets the \u201cright price\u201d, citing the case of Digi.Com Bhd .\nIn 1999, Tan sold his stake in Digi, which was then known as Digi.Swisscom Bhd, and walked away from the investment with a bounty estimated at more than RM1.5bil.\nAs at end-July, BCorp\u2019s total assets stood at RM20.5bil, with cash and cash equivalents totalling RM1.3bil. The group had debts totalling RM5.8bil, of which, RM3.2bil were short-term obligations.\nRelated story:\nTan has penchant for getting the top dollar\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Berjaya , Vincent Tan\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

They have attracted investors\u2019 interest post the Chinese New Year celebration.\nNaim, KKB, HSL and CMS are the main contractors of the on-going RM16bil Pan Borneo Highway project. Most of them are teaming up with the country\u2019s leading construction firms to bid for the new contracts.\nNaim, according to its managing director Datuk Hasmi Hassan, is teaming up with Gamuda Bhd to bid for the Sarawak coastal highway and second trunk road project. Naim and Gamuda are joint venture partners in undertaking one of 11 Pan Borneo highway work packages\nKKB\u2019s joint venture partner in the Pan Borneo highway project is WCT Holding Bhd. The KKB-WCT JV have been pre-qualified for both the Sarawak coastal highway and second trunk road project.\nKKB, which is Sarawak\u2019s sole steel water pipe manufacturer, has also tendered for the new water supply project under the state water grid. Besides construction, the company is expected to benefit from the supply of the pipes to other contractors who get the job.\nHSL managing director Datuk Paul Yu Chee Hoe has also said his company was eyeing for jobs in both coastal road and trunk road projects as well as contracts associated with the state water grid.\nCMS\u2019s joint venture partner in Pan Borneo highway project is Bina Puri Holdings Bhd.\n\u201cThe early work packages of the Sarawak coastal highway project are expected to be awarded in the coming weeks.\n\u201cOpen tender for three of the packages were carried out in November, 2018 and two more last month. Evaluation of the bids is expected to take between one and two months as the project is to be fast-tracked,\u201d an industry source told StarBiz.\nThe first three work packages tendered out are the proposed construction of Pasi road to Sibu/Tanjung Manis road, including Batang Rejang bridge, in Sarikei division, Muara Lassa bridge in Mukah division and Bintulu-Jepak bridge crossing Kuala Kemena in Bintulu division.\nThe fourth and fifth work packages, bidding of which commenced last month, are the proposed construction of Batang Saribas bridge in Betong Division and Batang Paloh bridge in Mukah division.\nThe proposed Sarawak coastal highway spans some 900km from Sematan in southern Sarawak to Miri. The second trunk road will provide shorter routes to the main trunk road, link up the Pan Borneo highyway and coastal road network.\nThe second trunk road is divided into three sections, the first being a 112km single carriageway from Kota Samarahan to Roban, Betong division (existing road distance is 155km).\nThe second section involves a 94km single carriageway to link Sebuyau and Sri Aman/Betong and the third will involve the upgrading and extension of the existing two-lane carriageway from Jalan Kelupu in Bintangor to Lanang Bridge in Sibu.\nFor the second trunk road project, companies have been invited to bid for some 15 components of three main work packages from January to March. Most of the components are new bridge projects over the many rivers in southern and central Sarawak regions.\nThe sources noted that contracts for the state water grid project (total of 247 contracts) have been awarded progressively since late last year. Most of the contracts are rural-based and in stressed areas.\nThe contracts included the construction of new water treatment plants, distribution system, pipe replacement and upgrading works of existing facilities.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nConstruction , Sarawak Infrastructure\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS22 Jan 2019\nFirst package of Sarawak highway project completed\nCORPORATE NEWS29 Jan 2019\nSarawak tycoon raises stake in Naim to 25.2%\nPROPERTY25 Feb 2019\nYKGI expanding to Peninsular Malaysia"

It will take time to come back on track.\nA slew of contracts is given out, but is it enough to spur the sector?\nAFTER a roller-coaster year that saw many reviews and cancellations of major local infrastructure projects following a change in government control, some green shoots have started to sprout within the sector.\nJust yesterday, a resolution to the multi-billion-ringgit light rail transit three (LRT3) project seems to have been secured with a new contract signed between government agency, Prasarana Malaysia Bhd, and the main contractors. Similarly, reports had emerged that the government had cancelled another mega-project, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), which was previously given to a Chinese party. It is said that this project now will be dished out to local players.\nIn addition, phase two of the Klang Valley double-track rail upgrade project is expected to start soon, while sub-contracts for the Gemas-Johor Baru electrified double-track rail project are increasingly being dished out.\nBut is this enough for industry players to believe that a revival is taking off?\nBased on checks with industry players, the jury is still out on this, although the slew of contracts recently suggests that there is some hope.\nNew deal: The LRT3 project is back with a new contract signed between Prasarana and the main contractors.\n\u201cThe industry is still in a state of flummox, there will be a lot of re-tendering. It will take time to come back on track, probably only in 2020,\u201d a seasoned construction player tells StarBizweek.\n\u201cThe new government must remember not to just chop, chop, chop the (construction) jobs to save money... it must remember that the construction industry is responsible for a huge portion of the economic multiplier effect in the country,\u201d he adds.\nSunway University Business School economics professor Yeah Kim Leng says he expects the industry to perform only \u201cabout the same or marginally better\u201d this year compared to the last.\nThere\u2019s no outright revival and no construction boom, Yeah says.\nHaving said that, he sees an uptick in civil engineering activities as some of the big-sized infrastructure and transportation projects under review last year have received the go-ahead at a lower cost, while selective residential projects in high-demand locations will be implemented as planned by large developers with deep pockets.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

            "Content": "PETALING JAYA: The strong recovery enjoyed by oil and gas (O&G) stocks since the start of the year seems to have come to an abrupt halt.\nO&G counters have seen a sharp fall over the past few days, as investors took profit and appeared to be taking a breather from the sector while waiting for the companies to deliver their earnings.\nPrior to this, some local O&G counters saw their share prices shooting up by over 200% in the past three months, boosted by the recovery in crude oil prices as well as Petroliam Nasional Bhd\u2019s (Petronas) plans to raise its capital expenditure (capex) this year.\nAmong the counters that has seen a dip in recent days after recording a spectacular rise during the year-to-date period is Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd.\nThe O&G support services provider saw its share price climbing 216% until the end of last week, before dipping 17.5% over the past three days to close at RM1.41 yesterday.\nOthers which have seen a similar pattern include Petra Energy Bhd, which rose 191.3% to a high of RM1.18 earlier this month before dipping 12.7% since then to close at RM1.03.\nCarimin Petroleum Bhd, meanwhile, fell 8.4% over the past two days to 87 sen, following a 134.5% surge in its share price.\nTwo other counters, Alam Maritim Resources Bhd and Velesto Energy Bhd, fell 23.3% and 4.84% in recent days, following significant increases of 87.5% and 72.2%, respectively, during the year-to-date period.\nThe O&G sector has been among the top performers on the stock exchange this year, with the Bursa Malaysia Energy Index having risen 26% in the year-to-date period.\nCrude oil prices have been rising since December, as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its partners cut output, with Brent crude hitting a four-month high of S$67.61 per barrel on Tuesday.\nPetronas, meanwhile, in its recently released Activity Outlook 2019-21 report, said it would spend slightly more than RM50bil on capex in 2019, up from RM47bil last year.\n\u201cI believe investors are taking a breather from the sector while waiting for earnings delivery,\u201d Kenanga Research O&G analyst Sean Lim said.\nHe said there was a lot of expectation that the sector would do better this year compared with last year, and that earnings would pick up.\n\u201cO&G players are generally expected to do better this year. In the short term, the oil price will be key in determining sentiment surrounding the sector,\u201d he told StarBiz.\nIf oil prices continue to rise towards the US$70-per-barrel mark, he said, O&G counters should pick up again.\nMoving forward, MIDF Research, in its second-quarter outlook for the sector, said it has maintained its \u201cneutral\u201d stance on the upstream sub-segment due to the stabilising crude oil price environment, expected increase in offshore exploration and production capex, expected increase in offshore activity levels and sustained demand for petrochemical products globally.\nIt also reiterated its positive stance on the downstream sub-segment.\nFor the upstream services segment, the research house said it was bullish on Dayang, as the company is expected to benefit from rising crude oil and LNG selling prices, increased shallow-water and deep-water activities and more active offshore maintenance works.\n\u201cFor the downstream sub-sector of the O&G industry, we maintain our bullish stance on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Gas Malaysia Bhd, as we remain sanguine on the future prospects of the downstream business due to the robust global demand for the crude derivatives,\u201d it said.\nThe research house has also maintained its Brent crude oil target of US$75 per barrel in anticipation of further production supply cuts from Opec, a positive resolution to US-China trade tensions and a full sanction on Iran to begin in May.\n    Related News\nCORPORATE NEWS29 Jan 2019\nAstro to gain if Android TV boxes banned\nECONOMY21 Jan 2019\nFitch: Private consumption to remain strong\nBANKING07 Feb 2019\nNeutral outlook seen for banking sector"

            "Content": "AS the first Malaysian managing director of brewery giant Heineken Malaysia Bhd , much will be expected of Roland Bala, the 53-year-old Sarawakian who assumed the role six months ago.\nHis task would be to not only maintain Heineken Malaysia\u2019s leading market share in the local beer market but also consistently try to do better than its competitor Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd .\nGoing by Roland\u2019s track record though, heading Heineken Malaysia through its next course seems like a role he was destined for.\nAs a young boy, Roland had to brave the elements and environment. Growing up in a small village in Sarawak, Bala had to travel far each day for his education.\nThat hardship and determination had served him well as he displayed the traits of not wanting to fail, when he secured his very first job.\nRoland, along with his university classmates, had applied for the management trainee position at British Petroleum (BP).\nWhen he found out that he was not selected for the job interview, Roland then thumbed through Yellow Pages and called up the office of BP.\nIntrigued by Roland\u2019s persistence, the human resource director then granted him an interview.\n\"I believe that my life experience has equipped me with a lot of courage, so I have no fear of these kinds of challenges. I am more concerned about how I can contribute and deliver results.\" - Roland Bala\nAt the end of the selection process, Roland was one of the five hired to be a management trainee at BP, from a pool of 4,500 applicants.\nRoland spent 16 years of his career at BP.\n\u201cWhen I look back at my career path, it has always been about taking those bold steps that made a difference.\n\u201cIt is important to know what you want and be daring enough to make the bold move.\n\u201cAt the age of 41, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and venture into the unknown, by joining the beer industry \u2013 partly for the love of beer!\n\u201cBut it was mainly for the opportunity to run an operating company, which provided a new challenge and I had a lot to learn,\u201d says Roland.\nRoland joined Heineken in 2008, and has served the group in Singapore, Vietnam, and Cambodia, before returning to his homeland last year.\nRelated story:\nBreweries mitigate price increase pressure\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth.\"\nA CAPITAL market is commonly described as \"up\" or \"down\". In the rush of our modern world, coupled with social media being mistaken for genuine news, a market is often shrunk down to labels, symbols and colours even - like \"red\" or \"green\", \"growing\" or \"shrinking\" and even \"big\" or \"small\". \n\nThese simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They're also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\n\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. \n\nBut behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n\nMalaysia's capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. \n\nThey've grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\n\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It's not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\n\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\n\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. \n\nThey also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. \n\nBuilding sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation's development.\n\nThe lifeblood of a nation's economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. \n\nFlush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\n\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation's GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. \n\nFor SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. \n\nThere are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\n\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. \n\nEvery day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n\nInnovation isn't always about the newest. Sometimes, it's about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\n\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world's first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world's first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\n\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\n\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\n\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. \n\nLiterally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\n\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still 'young', as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point.

            "Content": "Datuk Umar Swift: \"Bursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth.\"\nA CAPITAL market is commonly described as \"up\" or \"down\". In the rush of our modern world, coupled with social media being mistaken for genuine news, a market is often shrunk down to labels, symbols and colours even - like \"red\" or \"green\", \"growing\" or \"shrinking\" and even \"big\" or \"small\". \n\nThese simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They're also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\n\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. \n\nBut behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n\nMalaysia's capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. \n\nThey've grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\n\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It's not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\n\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\n\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. \n\nThey also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. \n\nBuilding sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation's development.\n\nThe lifeblood of a nation's economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. \n\nFlush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\n\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation's GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. \n\nFor SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. \n\nThere are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\n\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. \n\nEvery day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n\nInnovation isn't always about the newest. Sometimes, it's about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\n\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world's first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world's first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\n\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\n\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\n\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. \n\nLiterally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\n\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still 'young', as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\n\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\n\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\n\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\n\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit. But it is a purpose that we at Bursa Malaysia take to heart, as we put our minds and souls into developing the connections that bring it all together.\n\"Modern problems surely require new solutions. Let's see things afresh, and work together from there,\" Datuk Umar Swift, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia.\n  TAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Markets\n    Related News\nMARKETS18 Feb 2019\nForeign investors turn net sellers again\nMARKETS25 Feb 2019\nBursa Malaysia sees second straight week of net foreign selling\nMARKETS06 Mar 2019\nKLCI ends moderately higher"

We gather that the group aims to at least sustain its FY1 DPS at a level similar to FY18, which is achievable, as it has been paying out c.100% of its earnings (dividend policy: 75% payout) over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWe cut our FY19-21F by 0.2%-3% to factor in the higher operating costs. Our target price is revised to RM3.11, still based on 20.5 times FY20F P/E (one-year mean P/E). \n\n\u201cWe like Gas Malaysia for its stable earnings profile and attractive dividend yield of c.5% for FY19-21F. We see limited earnings impact on the group arising from potential reforms in the power sector.

            "Content": "A CAPITAL market is commonly described as \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d. In the rush of our modern world, coupled with social media being mistaken for genuine news, a market is often shrunk down to labels, symbols and colours even - like \u201cred\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cgrowing\u201d or \u201cshrinking\u201d and even \u201cbig\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d. These simplistic opinions rarely provide proper insight. They\u2019re also the reason many prime opportunities slip by unnoticed, and value is left uncaptured.\nBursa Malaysia believes that a capital market is about making connections. In its most basic form, it connects capital to businesses, turning idle capital into fuel that enable businesses to drive growth. But behind this simple definition, there are four key areas where these connections also drive national progress \u2013 in economies, societies and across entire regions.\n> Connecting businesses to a global base\nMalaysia\u2019s capital market has supported the creation of regional champions and global players - household names such as AirAsia, Maybank, Sime Darby, IHH Healthcare, Maxis, Axiata, CIMB and Public Bank. They\u2019ve grown, captured profitable segments and delivered strong value propositions for the stakeholders. They also provide many opportunities to harness and groom the capabilities of Malaysian talent.\nThe connections also work in the other direction \u2013 where global or regional businesses build bases with local partners. It\u2019s not just about representative offices, but entire factories, research facilities and other higher-value operations.\nToday, they operate in sectors as varied as electronic, manufacturing, and chemicals, to packaged foods and even hospitality.\nThe value created is far-reaching and mutually beneficial \u2013 they provide employment and talent development across a broad segment of Malaysian society. They also signal an openness and willingness to grow, collaborate and trade with an increasingly borderless world. Building sustainably upon these strengths would see us welcoming higher-value added businesses - a powerful value proposition and broad driver for the nation\u2019s development.\n> Connecting to the future\nThe lifeblood of a nation\u2019s economy, nimble and highly-motivated SMEs have the opportunity to become future regional and global champions. Flush with ideas and energy, SMEs need the capital market to help connect and drive these critical ingredients and also provide greater visibility and awareness.\nMalaysian SMEs already contribute over a third of the nation\u2019s GDP, and continue to grow. To meet the requirements of listed companies, they develop robust business disciplines through practices such as good corporate governance and material economic, environmental and social risk opportunity assessments. For SMEs, these efforts help strengthen their business models and competitiveness at a crucial stage in their development.\n> Connecting Malaysians to the idea of investing\nImagine a nation of savvy investors who understand and appreciate the purpose of investing, and can harness it well over the long term. Bursa Malaysia has dedicated much effort and resources into developing opportunities to help investors of all sizes and experience levels. There are various products that provide appropriate exposure, catering to different risk appetites and sophistication.\nAs evident in developed markets, investor education plays a key role in creating a wider group of astute investors. Bursa Malaysia conducts numerous investor education programmes via several platforms \u2013 seminars, workshops and digital resources. Every day, we reach more Malaysians - enabling, enhancing and grooming their ability to function as mature and well-informed investors.\n> Connecting innovation to progress\nInnovation isn\u2019t always about the newest. Sometimes, it\u2019s about building the right connections between strengths that exist, and nascent long-term trends.\nAn example is Islamic finance. A long-recognised leader, Bursa Malaysia continues to build upon this success, launching a number of innovations \u2013 for example, Bursa Malaysia-i (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah investing platform which incorporates the full range of exchange-related services), and BSAS (the world\u2019s first end-to-end syariah-compliant, commodity Murabahah trading platform). These novel syariah investing platforms have quickly garnered global recognition.\nQuite importantly, these markets also help connect us to the movement amongst international investors towards SRI or socially responsible investing. Closely related, Shariah compliant investing and SRI share a number of common principles.\nThey both aim to develop sustainable business practices that create positive benefits across society, in addition to promoting transparent, mutually-beneficial and balanced development.\nAnother connection comes from Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) contracts, a global benchmark for many decades now. Price predictability and stability in a commodity of this nature impacts an immensely long value chain with far-reaching effects. Literally, it maintains economic value and make social opportunities sustainable all the way from farm to fork.\nA recent innovation is the LEAP market, which provides greater accessibility to capital and visibility that can help entrepreneurs see through their challenges and drive growth. Although still \u2018young\u2019, as at end 2018, companies listed in LEAP have seen their market capitalisation increase by 49% on average.\n> Making it possible through ambition, purpose and clarity\nSeeing a market as a series of far-reaching connections between capital, business and society provides a check-point. The scale of what a well-run, liberalised and innovative capital market can provide for the nation is immense, and humbling in many ways.\nWe can always look at the world-leading innovations that are now in place, the notable global and regional champions we have helped build, the innovations that help us swim with the current of global investing practices and the efforts to groom future champions amongst the entrepreneurial-minded.\nBursa Malaysia will continue to capitalise on our strengths to bring forth even more development.\nWe aspire to create even more of these kinds of connections, across a wider group of parties, and give them the right shape and form that they may reach deeper into society and deliver the kind of value that continues to build for generations.\nIn short, creating opportunities and growing value is a lifelong pursuit. But it is a purpose that we at Bursa Malaysia take to heart, as we put our minds and souls into developing the connections that bring it all together.\n\u201cModern problems surely require new solutions. Let\u2019s see things afresh, and work together from there.\u201d Datuk Umar Swift, CEO of Bursa Malaysia.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMarkets , Bursa Malaysia , Connections\n    Related News\nMARKETS18 Feb 2019\nForeign investors turn net sellers again\nMARKETS25 Feb 2019\nBursa Malaysia sees second straight week of net foreign selling\nMARKETS06 Mar 2019\nKLCI ends moderately higher"

While greater competition is good for the end-consumers, many logistics players have been hit by margin erosion as a result.\nThis year\u2019s third quarter earnings season ended up unfavourable for the logistics sector. In the period of July to Sept 2018, the bottom line of logistics providers Tasco Bhd and GD Express Carrier Bhd declined by 70% and 18% year-on-year (y-o-y), respectively.\nCJ Century Logistics Holdings Bhd saw its earnings dipping by 3.6% y-o-y, while Xin Hwa Holdings Bhd \u2019s net profit fell by nearly 33% y-o-y. Pos Malaysia Bhd took a greater hit compared to its sector peers as the group fell into red in the three-month period, with a net loss of RM16.58mil.\nUnlike the others, Tiong Nam Logistics Holdings Bhd \u2019s earnings story turned out slightly different in the latest quarter. Its core logistics and warehousing business segment returned to the black with a pre-tax profit of RM4.9mil, as higher deliveries and new clientele pushed the segment\u2019s revenue up by 9.1% y-o-y to RM137.8mil.\nHowever, Tiong Nam\u2019s overall earnings at the group level took a plunge by 82% y-o-y to RM2.22mil in its second quarter ended Sept 30, as topline was slashed by about 12%.\nThe major reason? Disappointing property sales. Declining progress billing due to the group\u2019s property development projects reaching completion dragged down the segment\u2019s revenue by nearly 71% y-o-y in the second quarter.\nTiong Nam recorded a sharply-lower unbilled sales of RM2mil in the second quarter as compared to RM80.2mil a year earlier, post-completion of its Pinetree Marina Resort development.\nMoving forward, the group only has one project in the pipeline \u2013 the Kota Masai township \u2013 which will likely be launched by March 2019 with an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM150mil.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Tiong Nam\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

There are many 'key magnets' here including EduCity, Legoland, Puteri Harbour, Southern Industrial and Logistics Cluster (SiLC), Pinewood Studios and private hospitals,\" he said.\nTan explained that connectivity was also good, and not just access to the Second Link or Coastal Highway but also to Indonesia via a ferry terminal in Puteri Harbour.\nHe added that so far the take up rate for their developments in Nusa Sentral has been good since it was launched in 2010.\n\"At least 90% of our buyers are those wanting to live there and 90% of them are locals,\" he said, adding that so far at least 75% of their landbank in Nusa Sentral has been developed.\nTan added that the remaining 25% would be used up in the next three years and the company, which is regarded as a township developer, has already purchased another 66ha-site opposite Marlborough College in Iskandar Puteri.\n\"We believe that there will continue to be strong demand for landed residential properties priced between RM700,000 and RM1mil in Johor Bahru,\" he said, adding that the housing glut in the state was mainly for high-rise apartments and condominiums.\nCountry View Bhd head of sales Andrew Tan: \"We believe that the Iskandar Puteri area, which is in Zone B in Iskandar Malaysia, is a strong growth corridor not just in Johor but the country.\"\nHe added that Country View is a company involved in building landed property and also a strong believer in multi-generational living.\n\"We are one of the few developers who build three-storey homes to allow different generations to live all under one roof.\n\"Also some of our homes comes with the option of having a lift indoors,\" he said, adding that all their properties in Nusa Sentral were freehold.\nTan added that all their precincts were gated and guarded with 24-hour security and landscaped parks.\nAmong their upcoming launches at Nusa Sentral include three-storey shop offices, three-storey cluster costing about RM950,000 and semi-detached units which will be priced above RM1mil.\n\"We believe there is a demand for houses below RM1mil. Anyway our house prices have always appreciated over the years,\" he said, adding that last year their new launch of 74 units of homes priced RM849,000 to RM899,000 were snapped up on the first day of the sales launch.\nTan's advice for first-time house buyers are:\n> Always work out your budget so that you will be able to meet the loan repayments.\n> Check for promotions and housing packages that are available as nowadays there are plenty of promotional packages in the market.\n> Check on the track record and background of the housing developer before inking the deal to avoid buying properties which later become abandoned projects or problematic.\n> Always purchase properties which meet your needs and not based on what you friends tell you to buy. Among the things to look out for include layout, space, rooms and amenities.\n> Know your legal rights especially under the Housing Developers Act as many people still do not know their rights as purchasers.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nProperty , Country View , Winter Sonata\n    Related News\nNATION05 Feb 2019\nProsperity campaign for the festive season\nBUSINESS NEWS26 Jan 2019\nJohor property market to stay muted\nNATION16 Feb 2019\n54-year-old dies in motorcycle crash on Second Link"

            "Content": "PETALING JAYA: The strong recovery enjoyed by oil and gas (O&G) stocks since the start of the year seems to have come to an abrupt halt.\nO&G counters have seen a sharp fall over the past few days, as investors took profit and appeared to be taking a breather from the sector while waiting for the companies to deliver their earnings.\nPrior to this, some local O&G counters saw their share prices shooting up by over 200% in the past three months, boosted by the recovery in crude oil prices as well as Petroliam Nasional Bhd\u2019s (Petronas) plans to raise its capital expenditure (capex) this year.\nAmong the counters that has seen a dip in recent days after recording a spectacular rise during the year-to-date period is Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd.\nThe O&G support services provider saw its share price climbing 216% until the end of last week, before dipping 17.5% over the past three days to close at RM1.41 yesterday.\nOthers which have seen a similar pattern include Petra Energy Bhd, which rose 191.3% to a high of RM1.18 earlier this month before dipping 12.7% since then to close at RM1.03.\nCarimin Petroleum Bhd, meanwhile, fell 8.4% over the past two days to 87 sen, following a 134.5% surge in its share price.\nTwo other counters, Alam Maritim Resources Bhd and Velesto Energy Bhd, fell 23.3% and 4.84% in recent days, following significant increases of 87.5% and 72.2%, respectively, during the year-to-date period.\nThe O&G sector has been among the top performers on the stock exchange this year, with the Bursa Malaysia Energy Index having risen 26% in the year-to-date period.\nCrude oil prices have been rising since December, as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its partners cut output, with Brent crude hitting a four-month high of S$67.61 per barrel on Tuesday.\nPetronas, meanwhile, in its recently released Activity Outlook 2019-21 report, said it would spend slightly more than RM50bil on capex in 2019, up from RM47bil last year.\n\u201cI believe investors are taking a breather from the sector while waiting for earnings delivery,\u201d Kenanga Research O&G analyst Sean Lim said.\nHe said there was a lot of expectation that the sector would do better this year compared with last year, and that earnings would pick up.\n\u201cO&G players are generally expected to do better this year. In the short term, the oil price will be key in determining sentiment surrounding the sector,\u201d he told StarBiz.\nIf oil prices continue to rise towards the US$70-per-barrel mark, he said, O&G counters should pick up again.\nMoving forward, MIDF Research, in its second-quarter outlook for the sector, said it has maintained its \u201cneutral\u201d stance on the upstream sub-segment due to the stabilising crude oil price environment, expected increase in offshore exploration and production capex, expected increase in offshore activity levels and sustained demand for petrochemical products globally.\nIt also reiterated its positive stance on the downstream sub-segment.\nFor the upstream services segment, the research house said it was bullish on Dayang, as the company is expected to benefit from rising crude oil and LNG selling prices, increased shallow-water and deep-water activities and more active offshore maintenance works.\n\u201cFor the downstream sub-sector of the O&G industry, we maintain our bullish stance on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Gas Malaysia Bhd, as we remain sanguine on the future prospects of the downstream business due to the robust global demand for the crude derivatives,\u201d it said.\nThe research house has also maintained its Brent crude oil target of US$75 per barrel in anticipation of further production supply cuts from Opec, a positive resolution to US-China trade tensions and a full sanction on Iran to begin in May.\n    Related News\nBUSINESS NEWS26 Jan 2019\nCan Can-One woo Kian Joo this time?\nCORPORATE NEWS29 Jan 2019\nAstro to gain if Android TV boxes banned\nECONOMY21 Jan 2019\nFitch: Private consumption to remain strong"

            "Content": "[ Type in your image caption here ]\n\nDOLOMITE Corp Bhd (code: 5835) has been on the upward momentum the past few months, but in volatile trade, amid fresh bargain hunting interest.\nThis stock rose from the 25-sen level in late August to achieve a high of 43 sen during intra-day session, the best in 16 months, before closing at 42.5 sen, up 3.5 sen yesterday. Based on the daily chart, Dolmite shares were generally trapped the past decade, as each time the bulls made an effort to mend, they could not attract follow-through support from investors. Hence, the momentum would pucture when prices were approaching or near the 55-sen barrier.\nA successful penetration of this pretty heavy resistance would see the fate of this counter changing better. This stock has the potential to make a breakthrough this time round, as the landscape and the underlying tone appear slightly better compared with the past. Perhaps, investors can consider accumulating some at current levels, if one is optimistic of the trend ahead. Otherwise, wait for the confirmation.\nElsewhere, the oscillator per cent K and the oscillator per cent D of the daily slow-stochastic momentum index were rising. It had triggered a short-term buy near the mid-range yesterday. The daily moving average convergence/divergence histigram expanded sharply and positively against the signal line to keep the bullish note. It had improved significantly since issuing a buy call on Sept 17. The past week saw the 14-day relative strength index hitting a high of 70 on Thursday before curving down slightly to finish at the 63-point level yesterday.\nTechnically, most of the indicators are positive, suggesting Dolmite shares are poised to advance in the immediate term, with the potential of making a major breakout of the 55-sen hurdle over the next few weeks. If successful, the next upside objective would be to challenge the upper resistance of 65 sen-67 sen band, or the 80 sen-82-sen range, depending on the aggressiveness of the buying sentiment. To the downside, important support is pegged at the 33 sen, followed closely by the 32-sen mark, which is the 14-day and 21-day simple moving average lines respectively. \u2014 \nThe comments above do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nEye On Stock , Dolomite Corp\n    Related News\nBUSINESS NEWS29 Jan 2019\nEni SpA to buy stake in Adnoc Refining for US$3.3bil\nCORPORATE NEWS28 Jan 2019\nAirAsia Group records 14% increase in passengers in 2018\nECONOMY28 Jan 2019\nUS Treasury set to borrow US$1 trillion for a second year to finance deficit"

Is it due to a structural issue or the pricing by promoters being deemed to be \u2018very high\u2019 by institutional placees and high net-worth investors? \u2014 AP\nNo big flotations last year, how will the upcoming big IPOs fare?\nINITIAL public offerings (IPOs) on the local bourse are increasingly losing their shine.\nAnd this year, the few big upcoming IPOs are re-listings, meaning these are companies that had been listed before, were later taken private and now are being re-listed.\nThis shows a dearth of new large companies in Malaysia.\nFlashback: DPI making its debut on the Ace Market earlier this month.  \nCompounding matters is the fact that the two big IPOs coming to market this year are poultry-linked companies which are trying to hit the market at very high values.\nQSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, which operates the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Pizza Hut chains, is reportedly looking to list at a historical price-earnings ratio (PER) of around 40 times and a forward PER of 30.\nThen, there is Leong Hup International Bhd that is involved in livestock feed manufacturing, egg production and poultry farming. It is said to be looking at a forward PER of around 30 times earnings.\nMr DIY, backed by private equity firm Creador, is exploring an IPO valuing the company at around RM10bil. This could mean listing at a toppish PER of at least 30 times historical earnings.\nThis likely means that the promoters of these stocks will find it tough to get investors to subscribe to them.\nBut first, why the dearth of new large companies coming to the market?\nOne economist explains the lack of mega-IPOs here as a structural issue the country is facing.\nHe points out that the number of high-tech companies in Malaysia has declined since 2000 and this, in turn, is the result of a lack of investments within this space.\n\u201cThere is a structural problem in Malaysia.\n\u201cPolicies need to be addressed to create a fertile ground for the creation of large high-tech companies,\u201d he says.\nFormer senior investment banker Ian Yoong Kah Yin says it\u2019s simply a case of the pricing of the IPOs by promoters being deemed to be \u201cvery high\u201d by institutional placees and high-net-worth investors.\n\u201cThe investment story has, therefore, to be compelling, mainly (have) high earnings growth potential or be at low earning multiples,\u201d he tells StarBizweek.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nMega\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

            "Content": "PETALING JAYA: Furniture makers and exporters are urging the Government to take steps to resolve the sector's labour shortage, which is said to be limiting growth for the industry.\nIn a recent interview, industry players told StarBiz that many furniture exporters had to turn down buyers due to production constraints.\n\u201cWe have to be selective where customers are concerned as we cannot meet demand. We need more foreign workers,\u201d said DPS Resources Bhd executive chairman Datuk Peter Sow.\nSow said it was difficult to retain skilled foreign workers.\n\u201cFurniture production is a labour intensive industry. At one time, we had more than 2,000 workers. Now, after a few years, we have less than 1,000 workers,\u201d he said.\nKlang-based Hup Chong Furniture Sdn Bhd managing director C.C. Chua said: \u201cBefore 2008, we had 1,200 workers. Now, we have only 700. So, we are short of 500 workers.\u201d Chua claimed that as of 2009, furniture makers had to pay a levy of RM1,250 per foreign worker.\n\u201cPreviously, the levy was borne by the foreign worker. Now, we find it difficult to retain them as they can easily leave our employment.\u201d\nSow pointed out that it was very difficult to hire local manpower in the furniture-making industry.\nMeanwhile, Malaysian International Furniture Fair (MIFF) 2012 organiser Datuk Dr Tan Chin Huat pointed out that Malaysia was among the top 10 furniture exporters in the world.\nIn 2010, Malaysia recorded US$2.46bil (RM7.4bil) in furniture exports, according to the CSIL Centre for Industrial Studies which is based in Milan, Italy.\nThe CSIL report said Malaysia was ranked 8th globally in 2010 in terms of the value of furniture exports, after China, Italy, Germany, Poland, Vietnam, United States and Canada.\nMalaysia External Trade Development Corp (Matrade) data showed that from January to October 2011, Malaysia recorded RM6.3bil worth of furniture exports which was a 6% year-on-year drop (compared with RM6.7bil in the same period in 2010). In the first 10 months of 2011, Malaysia's top export destination for furniture was the United States which accounted for 26.1% (or RM1.6bil).\nHowever, this was a 17.6% year-on-year drop in furniture exports to the United States (compared with RM1.98bil in the same period in 2010).\nChua said the drop in furniture exports to the United States was due to the economic turmoil in the world's largest economy.\n\u201cHopefully, this will be a better year as recent indicators point to some recovery in the United States economy. We should see growth in furniture exports to North America once the housing sector in the United States improve,\u201d he said.\nThe five-day MIFF 2012 is expected to generate record sales of US$800mil (RM2.4bil), compared with US$778mil (RM2.34bil) last year.\nAbout 500 furniture manufacturers and exporters will be participating at the 18th edition of the award-winning fair.\nLast year, the fair attracted more than 20,000 visitors including 6,502 international buyers from 140 countries.\nMIFF 2012 will be held from March 6 to 10 at Putra World Trade Centre and the Matrade Exhibition & Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur.\n    Related News\nECONOMY04 Mar 2019\nJanuary exports exceed forecast, boost from China, Thailand\nECONOMY01 Mar 2019\nTrade growth to remain muted early 2019, says RAM\nECONOMY30 Jan 2019\nRAM expects lacklustre export growth at 3.1% in December"

At the sales networks, adoption of global standards have ensured a more customer-oriented delivery\nprocess.\u201d\nThe company added that other business units within the group also continue pursuing operational improvements across the value-chain, as they move to enhance their business performance.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nCorporate News , Auto , Automotive\n    Related News\nAUTO30 Jan 2019\nDRB-Hicom unit forms auto parts JV with Jiangsu Xinquan\nAUTO22 Jan 2019\nGoldstar\u2019s legal claim puts DRB-Hicom under pressure\nCORPORATE NEWS29 Jan 2019\nDRB-Hicom forms JVco with Chinese auto parts maker to support Proton"

            "Content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd is looking to improve its revenue by 15% to 20% for the financial year 2019 (FY19) in light of the bullish outlook for the oil and gas (O&G) sector.\nGroup CEO Datuk Dr M.A. Karim Abdullah said the energy services company hoped its revenue would hit the RM4bil mark in 2019.\nIts FY18 results announced last month saw a 20.6% increase year-on-year in revenue to RM3.28bil.\n\u201cOur order book target for the year is RM10bil. It is currently at RM8.3bil. We believe RM10bil will be a good figure. (It is) achievable and will put the company on a good, strong foundation.\n\u201cWe are still regarded as an O&G industrial player and I strongly believe the sector in the Malaysian context this year is bullish,\u201d he said on the sidelines of Invest Malaysia 2019.\nKarim added that Petronas\u2019 announcement of a RM50bil capital expenditure would rejuvenate a lot of O&G activities.\nHe also expects oil prices to fluctuate between US$60 and US$70 per barrel, which is deemed as a \u201cvery good price\u201d although some would say it is still way below US$100.\n\u201cO&G players have undergone rationalisation programmes, meaning that they have looked into cutting down costs so that the profitability is there even at the price of US$30 a barrel.\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s almost double, you can see that the profit margins they are getting will be quite sizeable. In these kind of situations, they will have more money to invest and (this will help) rejuvenate the industry,\u201d he said.\nWhile O&G remains Serba Dinamik\u2019s largest revenue contributor at 80% to 85%, Karim said the company would like to reduce its dependency on the sector and was looking at increasing its contribution from the power-generation industry.\nHe also revealed that the company is currently bidding for almost RM20bil worth of contracts globally, such as in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Malaysia.\nSerba Dinamik has a tender success rate of around 20% to 30%.\n\u201cAfrica is a very lucrative region to look into. We have also entered into Central and South Asia, in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and India. These are all new markets where we have secured jobs,\u201d he said.\n    Related News\nAUTO24 Jan 2019\nMiti unit to speed up processing of auto incentives, says Ong\nAUTO25 Jan 2019\nLower price for cars?\nNATION30 Jan 2019\n\u2018Android boxes fuel content piracy\u2019"

            "Content": " M-MODE Bhd (code: 0059) made another break higher on the daily price chart on Friday as the momentum indicators turned towards a positive bias.\nThe stock has had a bullish mid-year starting in June as it ended a downtrend that began in mid January. After hitting bottom at 24.5 sen on May 31, the stock rebounded and began a strong ascent. A surge in buying interest on June 8 saw the counter gapping up a whopping 7% at the open and moving higher by another 16% before the close.\nThe rally saw the stock cross over key simple moving averages (SMA) to put itself on more bullish footing on the chart.\nThis strong price action saw the counter move into consolidation over the next seven trading sessions as investors awaited new leads. The 200-day SMA at 33 sen served as the bottom end of the trading range during this time, establishing itself as an immediate support. The slow-stochastic momentum index, which had spiked up to oversold conditions began to neutralise, drifting lower towards the 30-point mark.\nBut on Friday, the bulls made a comeback with the counter charting higher towards a session high of 39.5 sen. At its current trajectory, the stock is challenging the immediate resistance at 40 sen, a crossing of which would take it to the higher level of 42 sen.\nTo the downside, the immediate support rests at 35 sen with a more solid support in the event of accelerated profit-taking sitting at 33 sen. The slow-stochastic, which had been on the retreat, has once again returned to an upwards angle and is close to giving a \u201cbuy\u201d signal. The 14-day relative strength index has also turned bullish and returned to the overbought area.\nThe daily moving average convergence/divergence line is maintaining its upwards movement to put more distance from the signal line, suggesting growing strength in the uptrend.\nAt negative crossings between the key SMAs still stand owing to the five-month decline between January and May. It would take a sustained uptrend over the ensuing sessions to reverse this long-term bearish formation and confirm a return to the bulls.\nThe comments above do not represent a recommendation to buy or sell.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nStocks Analysis , Eye On Stock , M Mode\n    Related News\nANALYST REPORTS23 Feb 2019\nEye on Stock: Lii Hen Industries\nSTOCKS ANALYSIS02 Feb 2019\nProfit-taking dominates market\nSTOCKS ANALYSIS02 Feb 2019\nEye On Stock: Aeon Co (M)"

            "Content": "IT has been a tough couple of years for the property market, with developers seeing declines in revenue and sales.\nBut the gloomy environment has not deterred Paramount Corp Bhd, which is looking to repeat the record RM1bil sales it hit in 2018. Interestingly, among the property development companies, Paramount\u2019s share price has done quite well, increasing more than 50% over the last three years.\nOver that same period, property developers such as SP Setia Bhd fell 14%, Mah Sing Group Bhd declined by 26.3%, UEM Sunrise Bhd fell 25%, Eastern and Oriental Bhd plunged 42%, while Eco World Development Group Bhd and MCT Bhd fell 34% and 48%, respectively.\nIn a nutshell, property developers are facing a supply glut of residential properties. According to the Valuation and Property Services Department\u2019s (JPPH) unsold completed residential units rose to 30,115 units as at Sept 30, 2018, an increase of 48.35% from the 20,304 units a year ago. JPPH\u2019s latest figures show that the total value of unsold units was RM19.54bil, a 56.44% rise from RM12.49bil a year ago. Should serviced apartments and small offices home offices (SoHos) be included, the overhang value will rise to 40,916 units, valued at RM27.38bil.\nAs for Paramount, it should be noted that despite its 50% price appreciation, Paramount\u2019s shares are trading at an undemanding price earnings ratio (PE) of 9.5 times. So is there any more upside considering that this value is lower than many other property developers today?\nFor one, Paramount\u2019s property sales have been slowly increasing every year, despite the softening of the property market. RHB Research also notes that about 70% to 80% of most of Paramounts property launches are sold. For another, Paramount has been selling some of its assets including buildings and lands that had free up some cash and paying bumper dividends.\nIn 2017, the firm sold its Sri KDU Campus in Petaling Jaya for RM165mil to unlisted Alpha REIT (real estate investment trust), which led to Paramount dishing out a bumper dividend of 16 sen per share which at that time gave shareholders a 9% yield.\nIt is worth noting that excluding bumper dividend payment in 2017, Paramount has has been giving dividends yielding between 4%-6% annually, on a payout policy of 40% to 50%.\nUnlock exclusive insights, analyses, and curated news on the economy on The Star Online's Business section with Starbiz Premium.\nSubscribeLog In\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nProperty\n    More Stories\nMARKETS21 Mar 2019\nTrump says tariffs on Chinese goods will stay for \u2018substantial period of time\u2019\nSUPPORT LINE21 Mar 2019\nEG Industries\nMARKETS20 Mar 2019\nHigh-level US-China trade talks to resume in final push for deal\nSUPPORT LINE20 Mar 2019\nMajuperak\nCORPORATE NEWS19 Mar 2019\nMarriott plans to open over 1,700 hotels\nSUPPORT LINE19 Mar 2019\nCrest Builder"

It also provides a platform for us to bid for more projects that are able to churn out long-term recurring income,\u201d he adds.\nHe notes that KPMD is a good buy as its earnings are attractive and as a university concession, the revenue streams are long-term and stable even in a volatile economic condition.

            "Content": "AS expected, the stock market had a relatively wild ride on Monday, its first day of business following the momentous 14th General Election (GE14).\nIt stabilised quickly after that, finishing the week marginally higher.\nHowever, the same can\u2019t be said for a handful of stocks which performed like they were on steroids.\nWhile the benchmark index gained an overall of just 0.4% from May 8, the day before GE14 until Thursday this week, these stocks shot up like there was no tomorrow, putting on double-digit gains and charting new highs.\nEduspec Holdings Bhd took the top spot, gaining a whopping 91% from May 8 to May 17, making it the stock which gained the most, percentage-wise, on Bursa Malaysia. (refer to table for list of other top-performing stocks as well as worst-performing).\nEarlier in the week, Eduspec, an IT learning services provider had shot up more than 100%.\nIt was not the only one.\nEden Inc Bhd, Thriven Global Bhd, Advance Synergy Bhd , Opcom Holdings Bhd, Dolmite Corp Bhd and Ewein Bhd all registered double-digit gains.\nWere such increases in a matter of a week, justified?\nNotably, most were smallish companies, which safe to say, had run way ahead of their fundamentals.\nAmong these, ACE Market firm Eduspec, which provides systematic IT learning and robotics programs to school children. This firm is currently loss-making.\nFor its first quarter to Dec 31, 2017, Eduspec made a net loss of RM5mil on a revenue of RM6mil.\nBut the company is said to be linked to Datuk Yeow Kheng Chew, better known as KC Yeow, who is a close associate of Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s son, Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir.\nBoth KC and Mokhzani were once principal owners of oil and gas firm Kencana Capital Sdn Bhd before Yeow sold out to acquire Kencana\u2019s stake in Yinson Holdings Bhd, a company that operates floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels.\nOn Eduspec\u2019s latest top 30 shareholder list found in its annual report, a company known to be controlled by Yeow called Autonaire Sdn Bhd is listed as the single largest shareholder in Eduspec with a 9.056% stake.\nKencana Capital is listed as the eight largest shareholder with a 3.655% stake.\nFund management firm Areca Capital Sdn Bhd is also one of the substantial shareholders with a 7.545% interest.\nEduspec which derives most of its revenue from Malaysia, followed by Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong says in its annual report that the education sector remains competitive but it will continue to \u201csustain and improve the performance of the group by focusing on its strengths and improving on the quality of its offerings to schools\u201d.\nEden Inc, which is involved in the food, beverage and tourism business as well as energy and manufacturing, is a company linked to Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin, who is the son of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, the former deputy prime minister and current president of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, one of the parties that form the ruling government.\nFakhri is the son-in-law of Tan Sri Abd Rahim Mohamad and Puan Sri Fadzilah Md Ariff, who are the executive chairman and executive director of the firm, respectively.\nAbd Rahim\u2019s family controls close to 25% of Eden via a 10.92% stake in Zil Enterprise Sdn Bhd and a 14.07% interest in Serata Padu Sdn Bhd, according to its latest annual report.\nNotably, Fakhri who used to sit on the Eden board of directors resigned in December last year.\nEarnings-wise, Eden is also loss-making, chalking up a net loss of RM16.5mil in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17).\nNevertheless, compared to the same period a year earlier, its losses were narrowed.\nRevenue for FY17, meanwhile, stood at RM52mil.\nEden expects its energy sector business to help make this year a better year for the company as the two power plants it operates in Sandakan and Kelantan are expected to be fully re-commissioned after operating at limited capacities due to technical issues.\nThriven Global is also a company linked to Fakhri.\nThe company is involved in property development with projects across Peninsular Malaysia.\nIts flagship project is Lumi Tropicana, which comprises commercial and service apartments in Petaling Jaya.\nFor the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17), Thriven did see a turnaround, making a small net profit of RM201,000 versus a net loss of RM10.14mil in the previous year.\nThriven was previously known as Mulpha Land Bhd and changed its name following the entry of new major shareholders about three years ago.\nThese individuals include Ghazie Yeoh Abdullah, who is Mulpha Land\u2019s group managing director, Datuk Low Keng Siong and Fakhri.\nSince the entry of these individuals, Thriven has undergone a transformation of sorts and now has a cleaner balance sheet as compared to being debt-laden before which can to a certain extent, explain investor interest in it.\nAdvance Synergy is another politically-connected firm which has been seeing a lot of interest in the GE14 season.\nTo be sure, the firm which has diverse operations which include property development, hotels and resorts, had already started to make its way unto investor radar last year when it returned to the black with a net profit of RM4.07mil as opposed to a net loss of RM11.59mil previously.\nThe company is majority-controlled by 70-year-old Datuk Ahmad Sebi Bakar, a corporate high-flyer in the late 1980s who has often been linked to Tun Daim Zainuddin, a member of the Council of Eminent Persons and also Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Parti Keadilan Rakyat\u2019s de facto leader.\nOpcom Holdings was one the stocks which started to move up even before the GE14 fever gained traction. In the week leading to the GE, its shares had already rallied by 50% to 60.5 sen.\nAt one point during the period of May 8 to May 17, Opcom rose up to RM1.17.\nIt has since given up some of the gains to finish at 89.5 sen on Thursday, up 48%.\nThis company, involved in the manufacture of fibre optic cables and cable-related products is well-known for its connection to Mahathir\u2019s son, Mukhriz Mahathir who is one of the main shareholders of Opcom.\nHis brother, Mokhzani is the chairman and executive director at the firm.\nFor its latest quarter ended Dec 31, 2017, Opcom reported a net profit of RM586,000 on a revenue of RM27.5mil.\nMeanwhile, also dominating the gainers list this week but in terms of absolute price appreciation were the large-cap companies like British American Tobacco (BAT), Nestle (M) Bhd and Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd.\nNotably, all are consumer companies.\nIn a report to clients this week, AllianceDBS Research says consumer sentiment is expected to strengthen.\n\u201cWith the upcoming economic stimulus to be implemented by the newly elected Pakatan Harapan government, coupled with the feel good sentiment arising from the new administration, we believe that the Consumer Sentiment Index will continue to strengthen going forward which is generally positive for the consumer sector,\u201d it says.\nThe research house also upgraded BAT to a \u201cbuy\u201d this week , saying that the cigarette maker serves as the house\u2019s top pick \u201cfor exposure to the consumer recovery theme\u201d.\nTAGS / KEYWORDS:\nWinners , Stocks\n    Related News\nBUSINESS NEWS26 Jan 2019\nGreen shoots of construction revival\nECONOMY25 Feb 2019\nMalaysia in need of growth story\nCORPORATE NEWS21 Feb 2019\nStock rally eases pressure on Asia\u2019s financial conditions"
